For a snapshot schedule, you can change automatic collection times or the frequency of collection.

.About this task

You can import settings from an existing snapshot schedule, or you can modify settings as needed.

Because a snapshot schedule is associated to a snapshot group or snapshot consistency group, reserved capacity might be affected by changes to schedule settings.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Snapshots].
. Click the *Schedules* tab.
. Select the snapshot schedule that you want to change, and then click *Edit*.
+
The Edit Snapshot Schedule dialog box appears.

. Do one of the following:
 ** *Use a previously defined schedule from another snapshot object* -- Click *Import Schedule*, select the object with the schedule you want to import, and then click *Import*.
 ** *Edit the schedule settings* -- Refer to Field Details below.
