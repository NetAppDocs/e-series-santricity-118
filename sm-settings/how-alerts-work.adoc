Alerts notify administrators about important events that occur on the storage array. Alerts can be sent through email, SNMP traps, and syslog.

The alerts process works as follows:

. An administrator configures one or more of the following alerting methods in System Manager:
 ** *Email* -- Messages are sent to email addresses.
 ** *SNMP* -- SNMP traps are sent to an SNMP server.
 ** *Syslog* -- Messages are sent to a syslog server.
. When the storage array's event monitor detects an issue, it writes information about that issue to the event log (available from menu:Support[Event Log]). For example, issues can include such events as a battery failure, a component moving from Optimal to Offline, or redundancy errors in the controller.
. If the event monitor determines that the event is "alertable," it then sends a notification using the configured alerting methods (email, SNMP, and/or syslog). All Critical events are considered "alertable," along with some Warning and Informational events.

== Alerts configuration

You can configure alerts from the Initial Setup wizard (for email alerts only) or from the Alerts page. To check the current configuration, go to menu:Settings[Alerts].

The Alerts tile displays the alerts configuration, which can be one of the following:

* Not configured.
* Configured; at least one alerting method is set up. To determine which alerting methods are configured, point the cursor at the tile.

== Alerts information

Alerts can include the following types of information:

* Name of the storage array.
* Event error type related to an event log entry.
* Date and time when the event occurred.
* Brief description of the event.

[NOTE]
====
Syslog alerts follow the RFC 5424 messaging standard.
