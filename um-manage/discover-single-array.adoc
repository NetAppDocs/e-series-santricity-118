Use the Add/Discover Single Storage Array option to manually discover and add a single storage array to your organization's network.

.Before you begin

* The storage array must be correctly set up and configured.
* Storage array passwords must be set up using System Manager's Access Management tile.

.Steps

. From the Manage page, select *Add/Discover*.
+
The Add/Discover dialog box appears.

. Select the *Discover a single storage array* radio button.
. Enter the IP address for one of the controllers in the storage array, and then click *Start Discovery*.
+
It can take several minutes for Unified Manager to connect to the specified storage array.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Storage Array Not Accessible message appears when the connection to the IP address of the specified controller is unsuccessful.
====

. If prompted, resolve any self-signed certificates.
+
As part of the discovery process, the system verifies that the discovered storage arrays are using certificates by a trusted source. If it cannot locate a digital certificate for a storage array, it prompts you to resolve the certificate that is not signed by a recognized certificate authority (CA) by adding a security exception.

. If prompted, resolve any untrusted certificates.
+
Untrusted certificates occur when a storage array attempts to establish a secure connection to Unified Manager, but the connection fails to confirm as secure. Resolve untrusted certificates by importing a certificate authority (CA) certificate that has been issued by a trusted third party.

. Click *Next*.
. *Optional:* Associate the discovered storage array to a group: From the drop-down list, select the desired group to associate with the storage array.
+
The "All" group is selected by default.

. Enter the administrator password for the storage array that you want to add to your management domain, and then click *OK*.

.After you finish

The storage array is added to Unified Manager and, if specified, it is also added to the group you selected.

If automatic support data collection is enabled, support data is automatically collected for a storage array that you add.
