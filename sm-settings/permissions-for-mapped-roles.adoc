The RBAC (role-based access control) capabilities enforced on the storage array include pre-defined user profiles with one or more roles mapped to them. Each role includes permissions for accessing tasks in System Manager.

User profiles and mapped roles are accessible from menu:Settings[Access Management > Local User Roles] in the user interface of either System Manager.

The roles provide user access to tasks, as follows:

* *Storage admin* -- Full read/write access to the storage objects (for example, volumes and disk pools), but no access to the security configuration.
* *Security admin* -- Access to the security configuration in Access Management, certificate management, audit log management, and the ability to turn the legacy management interface (SYMbol) on or off.
* *Support admin* -- Access to all hardware resources on the storage array, failure data, MEL events, and controller firmware upgrades. No access to storage objects or the security configuration.
* *Monitor* -- Read-only access to all storage objects, but no access to the security configuration.

If a user does not have permissions for a certain task, that task is either grayed out or does not display in the user interface.
