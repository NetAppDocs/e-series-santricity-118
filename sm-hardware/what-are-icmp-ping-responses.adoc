Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is one of the protocols of the TCP/IP suite.

The `ICMP echo request` and the `ICMP echo reply` messages are commonly known as `ping` messages. `Ping` is a troubleshooting tool used by system administrators to manually test for connectivity between network devices, and also to test for network delay and packet loss. The `ping` command sends an `ICMP echo request` to a device on the network, and the device immediately responds with an `ICMP echo reply`. Sometimes, a company's network security policy requires `ping` (`ICMP echo reply`) to be disabled on all devices to make them more difficult to be discovered by unauthorized persons.
