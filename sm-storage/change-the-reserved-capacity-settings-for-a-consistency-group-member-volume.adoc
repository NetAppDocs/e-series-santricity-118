Alert me when...
a|
Use the spinner box to adjust the percentage point at which System Manager sends an alert notification when the reserved capacity for a member volume is nearing full.

When the reserved capacity for the member volume exceeds the specified threshold, System Manager sends an alert, allowing you time to increase reserved capacity or to delete unnecessary objects.


NOTE: Changing the Alert setting for one member volume will change it for _all_ member volumes that belong to the same consistency group.

Policy for full reserved capacity
a|
You can choose one of the following policies:

** *Purge oldest snapshot image* -- System Manager automatically purges the oldest snapshot image in the consistency group, which releases the member's reserved capacity for reuse within the group.
** *Reject writes to base volume* -- When the reserved capacity reaches its maximum defined percentage, System Manager rejects any I/O write request to the base volume that triggered the reserved capacity access.

. Click *Save* to apply your changes.

.Results

System Manager changes the reserved capacity settings for the member volume, as well as the reserved capacity settings for all member volumes in the consistency group.
