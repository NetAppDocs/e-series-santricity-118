[.lead]
You can increase reserved capacity, which is the physically allocated capacity used for any copy service operation on a storage object.

For snapshot operations, it is typically 40 percent of the base volume; for asynchronous mirroring operations, it is typically 20 percent of the base volume. Typically, you increase reserved capacity when you receive a warning that the storage object's reserved capacity is becoming full.

.Before you begin

* The volume in the pool or volume group must have an Optimal status and must not be in any state of modification.
* Free capacity must exist in the pool or volume group that you want to use to increase capacity.
+
If no free capacity exists on any pool or volume group, you can add unassigned capacity in the form of unused drives to a pool or volume group.

.About this task

You can increase reserved capacity only in increments of 8 GiB for the following storage objects:

* Snapshot group
* Snapshot volume
* Consistency group member volume
* Mirrored pair volume

Use a high percentage if you believe the primary volume will undergo many changes or if the lifespan of a particular copy service operation will be very long.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot increase reserved capacity for a snapshot volume that is read-only. Only snapshot volumes that are read-write require reserved capacity.
====

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Pools & Volume Groups].
. Select the *Reserved Capacity* tab.
. Select the storage object for which you want to increase reserved capacity, and then click *Increase Capacity*.
+
The Increase Reserved Capacity dialog box appears.

. Use the spinner box to adjust the capacity percentage.
+
If free capacity does not exist on the pool or volume group that contains the storage object you selected, and the storage array has Unassigned Capacity, you can create a new pool or volume group. You can then retry this operation using the new free capacity on that pool or volume group.

. Click *Increase*.

.Results

System Manager performs the following actions:

* Increases the reserved capacity for the storage object.
* Displays the newly-added reserved capacity.
