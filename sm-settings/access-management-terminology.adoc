| Term| Description
a|
Access token
a|
Access tokens are used to authenticate with the REST API or command line interface (CLI) in place of a username and password. Tokens are associated to a specific user (including LDAP users), and include a set of permissions and an expiration. 
a|
Active Directory
a|
Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft directory service that uses LDAP for Windows domain networks.
a|
Binding
a|
Bind operations are used to authenticate clients to the directory server. Binding usually requires account and password credentials, but some servers allow for anonymous bind operations.
a|
CA
a|
A certificate authority (CA) is a trusted entity that issues electronic documents, called digital certificates, for Internet security. These certificates identify website owners, which allows for secure connections between clients and servers.
a|
Certificate
a|
A certificate identifies the owner of a site for security purposes, which prevents attackers from impersonating the site. The certificate contains information about the site owner and the identity of the trusted entity who certifies (signs) this information.
a|
IdP
a|
An Identity Provider (IdP) is an external system used to request credentials from a user and to determine if that user is successfully authenticated. The IdP can be configured to provide multi-factor authentication and to use any user database, such as Active Directory. Your security team is responsible for maintaining the IdP.
a|
LDAP
a|
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services. This protocol allows many different applications and services to connect to the LDAP server for validating users.
a|
RBAC
a|
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users. RBAC controls are enforced on the storage array and include predefined roles.
a|
SAML
a|
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based standard for authentication and authorization between two entities. SAML allows for multi-factor authentication, in which users must provide two or more items for proving their identity (for example, a password and fingerprint). The storage array's embedded SAML feature is SAML2.0 compliant for identity assertion, authentication, and authorization.
a|
SP
a|
A Service Provider (SP) is a system that controls user authentication and access. When Access Management is configured with SAML, the storage array acts as the Service Provider for requesting authentication from the Identity Provider.
a|
SSO
a|
Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication service that allows for one set of login credentials to access multiple applications.
