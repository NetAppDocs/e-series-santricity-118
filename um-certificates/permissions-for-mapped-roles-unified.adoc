The RBAC (role-based access control) capabilities include pre-defined users with one or more roles mapped to them. Each role includes permissions for accessing tasks in Unified Manager.

The roles provide user access to tasks, as follows:

* *Storage admin* -- Full read/write access to storage objects on the arrays, but no access to the security configuration.
* *Security admin* -- Access to the security configuration in Access Management and Certificate Management.
* *Support admin* -- Access to all hardware resources on storage arrays, failure data, and MEL events. No access to storage objects or the security configuration.
* *Monitor* -- Read-only access to all storage objects, but no access to the security configuration.

If a user does not have permissions for a certain function, that function is either unavailable for selection or does not display in the user interface.
