[cols="25h,~",options="header"]
|===
| Function| Description
a|
Drives, controllers, and components views
a|
To switch between front and back shelf views, select either *Drives* or *Controllers & Components* from the far right (the link that appears depends on the current view). The *Drives* view shows drives and any empty drive bays. The *Controllers & Components* view shows the controllers, and any IOM (ESM) modules, power/fan canisters, or empty controller bays. At the bottom of the page, you can also select *Show all drives*.
a|
Drive view filters
a|
If the storage array contains drives with different types of physical and logical attributes, the *Hardware* page includes drive view filters. These filter fields help you quickly locate specific drives by limiting the drive types displayed on the page. Under *Show drives that are...*, click the filter field on the left (by default, shows *Any drive type*) to see a drop-down list of physical attributes (for example, capacity and speed). Click the filter field on the right (by default, shows *Anywhere in the storage array*) to see a drop-down list of logical attributes (for example, volume group assignment). You can use these filters together or separately.
[NOTE]
====
If the storage array contains drives that all share the same physical attributes, the *Any drive type* field on the left does not appear. If the drives are all in the same logical location, the *Anywhere in the storage array* field on the right does not appear.

Legend
a|
The components are displayed in certain colors to depict their role states. To expand and collapse the descriptions of these states, click *Legend*.
a|
Show status icon details
a|
The status indicators can include text descriptions for availability states. Click *Show status icon details* to show or hide this status text.
a|
Shelf/shelf icons
a|
Each shelf view provides a list of related commands, along with properties and status. Click *Shelf* to see a drop-down list of commands. You can also select one of the icons along the top to see status and properties for individual components: controllers, IOMs (ESMs), power supplies, fans, temperature, batteries, and SFPs.
a|
Shelf order
a|
The shelves can be rearranged on the Hardware page. Use the up and down arrows on the top right of each shelf view to change the top/bottom order of shelves.
