When creating and using snapshots, review the following requirements and guidelines.

== Snapshot images and snapshot groups

* Each snapshot image is associated with exactly one snapshot group.
* A snapshot group is created the first time you create a scheduled or instant snapshot image for an associated object. This creates reserved capacity.
+
You can view snapshot groups from the Pools & Volume Groups page.

* Scheduled snapshot images do not occur when the storage array is offline or powered off.
* If you delete a snapshot group that has a snapshot schedule, the snapshot schedule is also deleted.
* If you have a snapshot volume that you no longer need, you can reuse it, along with any associated reserved capacity, instead of deleting it. This creates a different snapshot volume of the same base volume. You can re-associate the snapshot volume or snapshot consistency group snapshot volume with the same snapshot image or a different snapshot image, as long as the snapshot image is in the same base volume.

== Snapshot consistency group

* A snapshot consistency group contains one snapshot group for each volume that is a member of the snapshot consistency group.
* You can associate a snapshot consistency group with only one schedule.
* If you delete a snapshot consistency group that has a snapshot schedule, the snapshot schedule is also deleted.
* You cannot individually manage a snapshot group that is associated with a snapshot consistency group. Instead, you must perform the manage operations (create snapshot image, delete snapshot image or snapshot group, and rollback snapshot image) at the snapshot consistency group level.

== Base volume

* A snapshot volume must have the same Data Assurance (DA) and security settings as the associated base volume.
* You cannot create a snapshot volume of a failed base volume.
* If the base volume resides on a volume group, the member volumes for any associated snapshot consistency group can reside on either a pool or volume group.
* If a base volume resides on a pool, all member volumes for any associated snapshot consistency group must reside on the same pool as the base volume.

== Reserved capacity

* Reserved capacity is associated with only one base volume.
* Using a schedule can result in a large number of snapshot images. Make sure you have sufficient reserved capacity for scheduled snapshots.
* The reserved capacity volume for a snapshot consistency group must have the same Data Assurance (DA) and security settings as its associated base volume for the snapshot consistency group member volume.

== Pending snapshot images

Snapshot image creation might remain in a Pending state in the following conditions:

* The base volume that contains this snapshot image is a member of an asynchronous mirror group.
* The base volume is currently in a synchronization operation. The snapshot image creation completes as soon as the synchronization operation is complete.

== Maximum number of snapshot images

* If a volume is a member of a snapshot consistency group, System Manager creates a snapshot group for that member volume. This snapshot group counts towards the maximum allowable number of snapshot groups per base volume.
* If you attempt to create a snapshot image on a snapshot group or snapshot consistency group, but the associated group has reached its maximum number of snapshot images, you have two options:
 ** Enable automatic deletion for the snapshot group or snapshot consistency group.
 ** Manually delete one or more snapshot images from the snapshot group or snapshot consistency group and retry the operation.

== Auto-deletion

If the snapshot group or snapshot consistency group is enabled for automatic deletion, System Manager deletes the oldest snapshot image when the system creates a new one for the group.

== Rollback operation

* You cannot perform the following actions when a rollback operation is in progress:
 ** Delete the snapshot image that is being used for the rollback.
 ** Create a new snapshot image for a base volume that is participating in a rollback operation.
 ** Change the associated snapshot group's Repository-Full Policy.
* You cannot start a rollback operation when any of these operations are in progress:
 ** Capacity expansion (adding capacity to a pool or volume group)
 ** Volume expansion (increasing the capacity of a volume)
 ** RAID level change for a volume group
 ** Segment size change for a volume
* You cannot start a rollback operation if the base volume is participating in a volume copy.
* You cannot start a rollback operation if the base volume is a secondary volume in a remote mirror.
* A rollback operation fails if any of the used capacity in the associated snapshot repository volume has unreadable sectors.
