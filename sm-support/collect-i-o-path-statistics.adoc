You can save the I/O path statistics file and send it to technical support for analysis.

.About this task

Technical support uses the I/O path statistics to help diagnose performance issues. Application performance issues can be caused by memory utilization, CPU utilization, network latency, I/O latency, or other issues. The I/O path statistics are collected automatically during support data collection or you can collect them manually. In addition, if you have AutoSupport turned on, the I/O path statistics are automatically collected and sent to technical support.

The counters for the I/O path statistics are reset after you confirm that you want to collect the I/O path statistics. The counters are reset even if you subsequently cancel the operation. The counters are also reset when the controller resets (reboots).

[NOTE]
