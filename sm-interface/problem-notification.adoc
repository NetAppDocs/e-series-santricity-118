Caution
|===
System Manager displays these icons in various locations.

* The Notifications area on the Home page displays the failed icon and a message.
* The Home page icon in the navigation area displays the failed icon.
* On the Components page, the graphics for drives and controllers display the failed icon.

== Alerts and LEDs

In addition, System Manager notifies you of problems in other ways.

* System Manager sends SNMP notifications or email error messages.
* The Service Action Required LEDs on the hardware come on.

When you receive notification of a problem, use the Recovery Guru to help you fix the problem. Where necessary, use the hardware documentation with the recovery steps to replace failed components.
