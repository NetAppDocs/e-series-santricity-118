If your controller includes a connection for NVMe over RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet), you can configure the NVMe port settings from the System page.

.Before you begin

* Your controller must include an NVMe over RoCE host port; otherwise, the NVMe over RoCE settings are not available in System Manager.
* You must know the IP address of the host connection.

.Steps

. Select menu:Settings[System].
. Under *NVMe over ROCE settings*, select *Configure NVMe over ROCE ports*.
. Select the controller with the NVMe over RoCE port you want to configure. Click *Next*.
. Select the HIC port you want to configure from the drop-down list. Click *Next*.
. Configure the port settings.
+
To see all port settings, click the *Show more port settings* link on the right of the dialog box.

| Port Setting| Description
a|
Configured ethernet port speed
a|
Select the speed that matches the speed capability of the SFP on the port.
a|
Enable IPv4 / Enable IPv6
a|
Select one or both options to enable support for IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

NOTE: If you want to disable port access, deselect both check boxes.

a|
MTU size     (Available by clicking *Show more port settings*.)
a|
If necessary, enter a new size in bytes for the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).

The default Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size is 1500 bytes per frame. You must enter a value between 1500 and 9000.

If you selected *Enable IPv4*, a dialog box opens for selecting IPv4 settings after you click *Next*. If you selected *Enable IPv6*, a dialog box opens for selecting IPv6 settings after you click *Next*. If you selected both options, the dialog box for IPv4 settings opens first, and then after you click *Next*, the dialog box for IPv6 settings opens.

. Configure the IPv4 and/or IPv6 settings, either automatically or manually.

| Port setting| Description
a|
Automatically obtain configuration
a|
Select this option to obtain the configuration automatically.
a|
Manually specify static configuration
a|
Select this option, and then enter a static address in the fields. (If desired, you can cut and paste addresses into the fields.) For IPv4, include the network subnet mask and gateway. For IPv6, include the routable IP address and router IP address.     If you are configuring an EF600 storage array with a 200Gb-capable HIC, this dialog box displays two sets of fields for network parameters, one for a physical port (external) and one for a virtual port (internal). You should assign unique parameters for both ports. These settings allow the host to establish a path between each port, and for the HIC to achieve maximum performance. If you do not assign an IP address to the virtual port, the HIC will run at approximately half its capable speed.
