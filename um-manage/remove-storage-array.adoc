You can remove one or more storage arrays if you no longer want to manage it from Unified Manager.

.About this task

You cannot access any of the storage arrays you remove. You can, however, establish a connection to any of the removed storage arrays by pointing a browser directly to its IP address or host name.

Removing a storage array does not affect the storage array or its data in any way. If a storage array is accidentally removed, it can be added again.

.Steps

. Select the *Manage* page.
. Select one or more storage arrays that you want to remove.
. Select menu:Uncommon Tasks[Remove storage array].
+
The storage array is removed from all the views in SANtricity Unified Manager.
