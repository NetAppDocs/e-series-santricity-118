You must set the network configuration for each controller--its Internet Protocol (IP) address, subnetwork mask (subnet mask), and gateway--when you use out-of-band management.

You can set the network configuration by using a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. If you are not using a DHCP server, you must enter the network configuration manually.
