You can create a volume as a container in which applications, databases, and file systems store data. When creating a volume, you also select a workload to customize the storage array configuration for a specific application.

== What are volumes and workloads?
A _volume_ is the logical component created with specific capacity for the host to access. Although a volume might consist of more than one drive, a volume appears as one logical component to the host. Once a volume is defined, you can add it to a workload. A _workload_ is a storage object that supports an application, such as SQL Server or Exchange, which you can use to optimize storage for that application.

== How do you create volumes and workloads?
First, you create a workload. Go to menu:Storage[Volumes] and open a wizard that guides you through the steps. Next, you create a volume from the capacity available in a pool or a volume group, and then assign the workload you created.
