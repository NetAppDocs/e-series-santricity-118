You can view graphical performance data for logical objects, physical objects, applications, and workloads.

.About this task

The performance graphs show historical data as well as live data currently being captured. A vertical line on the graph, labeled Live updating, distinguishes historical data from live data.

*Home page view*

The Home page contains a graph showing storage array level performance. You can select limited metrics from this view, or you can click *View Performance Details* to select all the available metrics.

*Detailed view*

The graphs available from the detailed performance view are arranged under three tabs:

* *Logical View* -- Displays performance data for logical objects grouped by volume groups and pools. Logical objects include volume groups, pools, and volumes.
* *Physical View* -- Displays performance data for the controller, host channels, drive channels, and drives.
* *Applications & Workloads View* -- Displays a list of logical objects (volumes) grouped by the application types and workloads you have defined.

.Steps

. Select *Home*.
. To select an array-level view, click the IOPS, MiB/s, or CPU button.
. To see more details, click *View Performance Details*.
. Select *Logical View* tab, *Physical View* tab, or *Applications & Workloads View* tab.
+
Depending on the object type, different graphs appear in each tab.

a|
Time frame
a|
Select the length of time you want to view (5 minutes, 1 hour, 8 hours, 1 day, 7 days, or 30 days). The default is 1 hour.

NOTE: Loading performance data for a 30-day time frame can take several minutes. Do not navigate away from the web page, refresh the web page, or close the browser while data is loading.

a|
Data point details
a|
Hover the cursor over the graph to see metrics for a particular data point.
a|
Scroll bar
a|
Use the scroll bar below the graph to view an earlier or later time span.
a|
Zoom bar
a|
Below the graph, drag the zoom bar handles to zoom out on a time span. The wider the zoom bar, the less granular the details of the graph.

To reset the graph, select one of the time frame options.
a|
Drag and drop
a|
On the graph, drag the cursor from one point in time to another to zoom in on a time span.

To reset the graph, select one of the time frame options.
