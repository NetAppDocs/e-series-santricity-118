Follow these guidelines before you create a mirror consistency group.

[NOTE]
====
Synchronous mirroring is not available on the EF600 or EF300 storage system.
====

You create a consistency group in Unified Manager in the Create Mirrored Pairs wizard.

Meet the following requirements for Unified Manager:

* The Web Services Proxy service must be running.
* Unified Manager must be running on your local host through an HTTPS connection.
* Unified Manager must be showing valid SSL certificates for the storage array. You can accept a self-signed certificate or install your own security certificate using Unified Manager and navigating to menu:Certificate[Certificate Management].

Also be sure to meet the following requirements for storage arrays:

* The two storage arrays must be discovered in Unified Manager.
* Each storage array must have two controllers.
* Each controller in both the primary array and secondary array must have an Ethernet management port configured and must be connected to your network.
* The storage arrays have a minimum firmware version of 7.84. (They can each run different OS versions.)
* You must know the password for the local and remote storage arrays.
* Your local and remote storage arrays are connected through a Fibre Channel fabric or iSCSI interface.
