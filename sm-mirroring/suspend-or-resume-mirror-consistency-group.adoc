[.lead]
You can suspend or resume the synchronization of data on all mirrored pairs within a mirror consistency group, which is more efficient than suspending or resuming synchronization on individual mirrored pairs.

.About this task

Suspending and resuming synchronization on groups helps to reduce any performance impact to the host application, which might occur while any changed data on the local storage array is copied to the remote storage array.

The state of the mirror consistency group and its mirrored pairs stay suspended until you use the Resume option to resume synchronization activity.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Asynchronous Mirroring].
. Select the *Mirror Consistency Groups* tab.
+
The Mirrored Consistency Group table appears and displays all the mirror consistency groups associated with the storage array.

. Select the mirror consistency group that you want to suspend or resume, and then select either menu:More[Suspend] or menu:More[Resume].
+
The system displays a confirmation.

. Select *Yes* to confirm.

.Results

System Manager performs the following actions:

* Either suspends or resumes data transfer between all mirrored pairs in a mirror consistency group without removing the mirror relationship.
* Logs any data that was written to the primary side of the mirror consistency group while the mirror group is suspended and writes the data automatically to the secondary side of the mirror consistency group when the mirror group is resumed. A full synchronization is not required.
* For a _suspended_ mirror consistency groups, displays *user-suspended* in the Mirror Consistency Groups table.
* For a _resumed_ mirror consistency group, data written to the primary volumes while the mirror consistency group was suspended is written to the secondary volumes immediately. Periodic synchronization resumes if an automatic synchronization interval has been set.
