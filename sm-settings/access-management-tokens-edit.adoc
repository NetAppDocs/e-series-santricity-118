You can edit settings for access tokens, which includes the expiration times and the ability to create new tokens.

.Steps

. Select menu:Settings[Access Management].
. Select the *Access Tokens* tab.
. Select *View/Edit Access Token Settings*.
. In the dialog box, you can perform one or both of these tasks:

** Enable or disable token creation.
** Change the expiration of existing tokens.
+
NOTE: When you de-select the *Enable access tokens* setting, it prevents both token creation and token authentication. If you later re-enable this setting, unexpired tokens can be re-used. If you want to permanently revoke all existing tokens, see link:access-management-tokens-revoke.html[Revoke access tokens].
+
. Click *Save*.
