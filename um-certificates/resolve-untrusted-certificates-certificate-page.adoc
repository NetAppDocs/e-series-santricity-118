Untrusted certificates occur when a storage array attempts to establish a secure connection to Unified Manager, but the connection fails to confirm as secure.

From the Certificate page, you can resolve untrusted certificates by importing a self-signed certificate from the storage array or by importing a certificate authority (CA) certificate that has been issued by a trusted third party.

.Before you begin

* You must be logged in with a user profile that includes Security Admin permissions.
* If you plan to import a CA-signed certificate:
 ** You have generated a certificate signing request (.CSR file) for each controller in the storage array and sent it to the CA.
 ** The CA returned trusted certificate files.
 ** The certificate files are available on your local system.

.About this task

You might need to install additional trusted CA certificates if any of the following are true:

* You recently added a storage array.
* One or both certificates are expired.
* One or both certificates are revoked.
* One or both certificates are missing a root or intermediate certificate.

.Steps

. Select *Certificate Management*.
. Select the *Trusted* tab.
+
This page shows all certificates reported for the storage arrays.

. Select either menu:Import[Certificates] to import a CA certificate or menu:Import[Self-Signed storage array certificates] to import a self-signed certificate.
+
To limit the view, you can use the *Show certificates that are...* filtering field or you can sort the certificate rows by clicking one of the column heads.

. In the dialog box, select the certificate, and then click *Import*.
+
The certificate is uploaded and validated.
