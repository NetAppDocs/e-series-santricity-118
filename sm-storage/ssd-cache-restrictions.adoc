Learn about the restrictions when using SSD Cache on your storage array.

== Restrictions

* Any volume assigned to use a controller's SSD Cache is not eligible for an automatic load balance transfer.
* Currently, only one SSD Cache is supported per storage array.
* The maximum usable SSD Cache capacity on a storage array is 10 TB.
* SSD Cache is not supported on snapshot images.
* If you import or export volumes that are SSD Cache enabled or disabled, the cached data is not imported or exported.
* You cannot remove the last drive in an SSD Cache without first deleting the SSD Cache.

== Restrictions with Drive Security

* You can enable security on SSD Cache only when you create the SSD Cache. You cannot enable security later as you can on a volume.
* If you mix drives that are secure-capable with drives that are not secure-capable in SSD Cache, you cannot enable Drive Security for these drives.
* Secure-enabled volumes must have an SSD Cache that is secure enabled.
