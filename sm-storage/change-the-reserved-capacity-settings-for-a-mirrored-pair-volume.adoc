Use the spinner box to adjust the percentage point at which System Manager sends an alert notification when the reserved capacity for a mirrored pair is nearing full.

When the reserved capacity for the mirrored pair exceeds the specified threshold, System Manager sends an alert, allowing you time to increase reserved capacity.


NOTE: Changing the Alert setting for one mirrored pair changes the Alert setting for all mirrored pairs that belong to the same mirror consistency group.
