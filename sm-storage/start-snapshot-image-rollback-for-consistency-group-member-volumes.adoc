= Start snapshot image rollback for snapshot consistency group member volumes
:experimental:

[.lead]
You can perform a rollback operation to change the content of snapshot consistency group member volumes to match the content that is saved in a snapshot image.

The rollback operation does not change the content of the snapshot images that are associated with the snapshot consistency group.

.Before you begin

* Enough reserved capacity is available to start a rollback operation.
* The selected snapshot image is Optimal and the selected volume is Optimal.
* The selected volume does not have a rollback operation already in progress.

.About this task

The rollback start sequence lets you start rollback on a snapshot image of a snapshot consistency group while providing options to add storage capacity. You cannot start more than one rollback operation for a snapshot consistency group at a time.

[NOTE]
====
The host has immediate access to the new rolled-back volumes, but the existing member volumes no longer allow host read-write access after the rollback starts. You can create a snapshot image of the member volumes just before starting the rollback to preserve the pre-rollback base volumes for recovery purposes.
====

The process to start rollback of a snapshot image of a snapshot consistency group is a multi-step procedure.

== Step 1: Select members

You must select the member volumes to be rolled back.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Snapshots].
. Select the *Snapshot Images* tab.
. Select the snapshot consistency group snapshot image, and then select menu:Rollback[Start].
+
The Start Rollback dialog box appears.

. Select the member volume or volumes.
. Click *Next*, and do one of the following:
 ** If any of the selected member volumes are associated with more than one reserved capacity object that stores snapshot images, the Review Capacity dialog box appears. Go to <<Step 2: Review capacity>>.
 ** If none of the selected member volumes are associated with more than one reserved capacity object that stores snapshot images, the Edit Priority dialog box appears. Go to <<Step 3: Edit priority>>.

== Step 2: Review capacity

If you selected member volumes associated to more than one reserved capacity object, such as a snapshot group and reserved capacity volume, you can review and increase reserved capacity for the rolled-back volume(s).

.Steps

. Next to any member volumes with very low (or zero) reserved capacity, click the *Increase capacity* link in the *Edit* column.
+
The Increase Reserved Capacity dialog box appears.

. Use the spinner box to adjust the capacity percentage, and then click *Increase*.
+
If free capacity does not exist on the pool or volume group that contains the storage object you selected and the storage array has Unassigned Capacity, you can add capacity. You can create a new pool or volume group and retry this operation using the new free capacity on that pool or volume group.

. Click *Next*, and go to <<Step 3: Edit priority>>.
+
The Edit Priority dialog box appears.

== Step 3: Edit priority

You can edit the priority of the rollback operation if needed.

.About this task

The rollback priority determines how many system resources are dedicated to the rollback operation at the expense of system performance.

.Steps

. Use the slider to adjust the rollback priority as needed.
. Confirm that you want to perform this operation, and then click *Finish*.

.Results

System Manager performs the following actions:

* Restores the snapshot consistency group member volumes with the content saved on the selected snapshot image.
* Makes the rolled-back volumes immediately available for host access. You do not need to wait for the rollback operation to complete.

.After you finish

Select menu:Home[View Operations in Progress] to view the progress of the rollback operation.

If the rollback operation is not successful, the operation pauses. You can resume the paused operation and, if still unsuccessful, follow the Recovery Guru procedure to correct the problem or contact technical support.
