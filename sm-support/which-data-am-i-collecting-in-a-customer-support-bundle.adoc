The AutoSupport feature and the manual Support Data Collection feature provide ways to collect data in a customer support bundle for remote troubleshooting and problem analysis by technical support.

The customer support bundle gathers all types of information about the storage array into a single compressed file. The information collected includes the physical configuration, logical configuration, version information, events, log files, and performance data. The information is used only by technical support to solve problems with the storage array.
