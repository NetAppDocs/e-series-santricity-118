If necessary, you can export Service Provider metadata for the storage array and re-import the file into the Identity Provider (IdP) system.

.Before you begin

* You must be logged in with a user profile that includes Security admin permissions. Otherwise, the Access Management functions do not appear.
* SAML is configured and enabled.

.About this task

In this task, you export metadata from the controller. The IdP needs this metadata to establish a trust relationship with the controller and to process authentication requests. The file includes information such as the controller domain name or IP address that the IdP can use for sending requests.

.Steps

. Select menu:Settings[Access Management].
. Select the *SAML* tab.
. Select *Export*.
+
The Export Service Provider Files dialog box opens.

. Click *Export* to save the metadata file to your local system.
+
[NOTE]
====
The domain name field is read-only.
====
+
Make a note of where the file is stored.

. From the local system, locate the XML-formatted Service Provider metadata file you exported.
. From the IdP server, import the Service Provider metadata file. You can either import the file directly or you can manually enter the controller information.
. Click *Close*.
