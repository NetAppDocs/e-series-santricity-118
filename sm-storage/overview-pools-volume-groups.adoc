You can create logical storage capacity from a subset of unassigned drives in your storage array. This logical capacity can take the form of either a pool or a volume group, depending on the needs of your environment.

== What are pools and volume groups?
A _pool_ is a set of logically grouped drives. A _volume group_ is a container for volumes with shared characteristics. You can use either a pool or volume group to create volumes accessible to a host.

== How do you create pools?
You can allow System Manager to create pools automatically when it detects unassigned capacity in a storage array. Alternatively, when automatic creation cannot determine the best configuration, you can create pools manually from menu:Storage[Pools & Volume Groups].
