[.lead]
You can re-create a snapshot volume or a snapshot consistency group snapshot volume that you previously disabled. Re-creating a snapshot volume takes less time than creating a new one.

.Before you begin

* The snapshot volume must be in either an Optimal or Disabled state.
* All member snapshot volumes must be in a Disabled state before you can re-create the snapshot consistency group snapshot volume.

.About this task

You cannot re-create an individual member snapshot volume; you can re-create only the overall snapshot consistency group snapshot volume.

[NOTE]
====
If the snapshot volume or snapshot consistency group snapshot volume is part of an online copy relationship, you cannot perform the re-create option on the volume.
====

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Snapshots].
. Select the *Snapshot Volumes* tab.
+
The Snapshot Volumes table appears and displays all the snapshot volumes associated with the storage array.

. Select the snapshot volume that you want to re-create, and then select menu:Uncommon Tasks[Recreate].
+
The Recreate Snapshot Volume dialog box appears.

. Select one of the following options:
 ** *An existing snapshot image created from volume <name>*
+
Select this option to indicate an existing snapshot image from which to re-create the snapshot volume.

 ** *A new (instant) snapshot image of volume <name>*
+
Select this option to create a new snapshot image from which to re-create the snapshot volume.
. Click *Recreate*.

.Results

System Manager performs the following actions:

* Deletes all `write` data on any associated snapshot repository volume.
* Snapshot volume or snapshot consistency group snapshot volume parameters remain the same as the previously disabled volume parameters.
* Retains the original names for the snapshot volume or snapshot consistency group snapshot volume.
