You can view data about the NVMe over Fabrics connections to your storage array.

.About this task

System Manager shows these types of NVMe over Fabrics statistics. All statistics are read-only and cannot be set.

* *NVMe Subsystem statistics* -- Shows statistics for the NVMe controller and its queue. The NVMe controller provides an access path between a host and the namespaces in the storage array. You can review the NVMe subsystem statistics for such items as connection failures, resets, and shutdowns.
* *RDMA Interface statistics* -- Provides statistics for all NVMe over Fabrics ports on the RDMA interface, which includes performance statistics and link error information associated with each switch port. This tab only appears when NVMe over Fabrics ports are available.

You can view each of these statistics as raw statistics or as baseline statistics. Raw statistics are all of the statistics that have been gathered since the controllers were started. Baseline statistics are point-in-time statistics that have been gathered since you set the baseline time.

.Steps

. Select menu:Support[Support Center > Diagnostics] tab.
. Select *View NVMe over Fabrics Statistics*.
. To set the baseline, click *Set new baseline*.
+
Setting the baseline sets a new starting point for the collection of the statistics. The same baseline is used for all NVMe statistics.
