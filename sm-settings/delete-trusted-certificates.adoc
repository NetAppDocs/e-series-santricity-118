* If you are updating a trusted certificate with a new version, the updated certificate must be imported before you delete the old certificate.

[CAUTION]
====
You might lose access to a system if you delete a certificate used to authenticate the controllers and another server, such as an LDAP server, before you import a replacement certificate.
