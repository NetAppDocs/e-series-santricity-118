To manage storage resources, you must first discover the storage arrays in the network.

== How do I discover arrays?
Use the Add/Discover page to find and add the storage arrays you want to manage in your organization's network. You can discover multiple arrays or you can discover a single array. To do this, you enter network IP addresses, and then Unified Manager attempts individual connections to each IP address in that range.

== How do I manage arrays?
After you discover arrays, go to the *Manage - All* page. From this page, you can scroll through a list of discovered storage arrays in your network, view their status, and perform operations on a single array or on a group of arrays.

If you want to manage a single array, you can select it and open System Manager.
