= Start snapshot image rollback for a base volume

[.lead]
You can perform a rollback operation to change the content of a base volume to match the content that is saved in a snapshot image.

The rollback operation does not change the content of the snapshot images that are associated with the base volume.

.Before you begin

* Enough reserved capacity is available to start a rollback operation.
* The selected snapshot image is Optimal and the selected volume is Optimal.
* The selected volume does not have a rollback operation already in progress.

.About this task

The rollback start sequence lets you start rollback on a snapshot image of a base volume while providing options to add storage capacity. You cannot start more than one rollback operation for a base volume at a time.

[NOTE]
====
The host can immediately access the new rolled-back base volume, but the existing base volume does not allow the host read-write access after the rollback begins. You can create a snapshot of the base volume just before starting the rollback to preserve the pre-rollback base volume for recovery.
====

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Snapshots].
. Select the *Snapshot Images* tab.
. Select the snapshot image, and then select menu:Rollback[Start].
+
The Confirm Start Rollback dialog box appears.

. *Optional:* Select the option to *Increase Capacity* if necessary.
+
The Increase Reserved Capacity dialog box appears.

 .. Use the spinner box to adjust the capacity percentage.
+
If free capacity does not exist on the pool or volume group that contains the storage object you selected and the storage array has Unassigned Capacity, you can add capacity. You can create a new pool or volume group and then retry this operation using the new free capacity on that pool or volume group.

 .. Click *Increase*.

. Confirm that you want to perform this operation, and then click *Rollback*.

.Results

System Manager performs the following actions:

* Restores the volume with the content saved on the selected snapshot image.
* Makes the rolled-back volumes immediately available for host access. You do not need to wait for the rollback operation to complete.

.After you finish

Select menu:Home[View Operations in Progress] to view the progress of the rollback operation.

If the rollback operation is not successful, the operation pauses. You can resume the paused operation and, if still unsuccessful, follow the Recovery Guru procedure to correct the problem or contact technical support.
