[.lead]
You remove a mirrored pair to remove the mirror relationship from the primary volume on the local storage array and the secondary volume on the remote storage array.

.About this task

Review the following information about orphaned mirrored pairs:

* An orphaned mirrored pair exists when a member volume in a consistency mirror group has been removed on one side (either the local storage array side or the remote storage array side) but not on the other side.
* Orphaned mirrored pairs are detected when inter-array communication is restored and the two sides of the mirror configuration reconcile mirror parameters.
* You can remove a mirrored pair to correct an orphaned mirrored pair state.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Asynchronous Mirroring].
. Select the *Mirrored Pair* tab.
+
The Mirrored Pairs table appears and displays all the mirrored pairs associated with the storage array.

. Select the mirrored pair that you want to remove, and then click *Remove*.
. Confirm that you want to remove the mirrored pair, and then click *Remove*.

.Results

System Manager performs the following actions:

* Removes the mirror relationship from the mirror consistency group on the local storage array and on the remote storage array, and deletes the reserved capacity.
* Returns the primary volume and the secondary volume to host-accessible, non-mirrored volumes.
* Updates the Asynchronous Mirroring tile with the removal of the asynchronous mirrored pair.
