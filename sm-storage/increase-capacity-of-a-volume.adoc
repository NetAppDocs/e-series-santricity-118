[.lead]
You can increase the reported capacity (the capacity reported to hosts) of a volume by using the free capacity that is available in the pool or volume group.

.Before you begin

* Enough free capacity is available in the volume's associated pool or volume group.
* The volume is Optimal and not in any state of modification.
* The maximum reported capacity of 256 TiB has not been reached for thin volumes.
* No hot spare drives are in use in the volume. (Applies only to volumes in volume groups.)

NOTE: You can only expand volume capacity up to 128 TiB at a single time.

.About this task

Keep in mind any future capacity requirements that you might have for other volumes in this pool or volume group. Make sure that you allow enough free capacity to create snapshot images, snapshot volumes, or remote mirrors.

[NOTE]
====
Increasing the capacity of a volume is supported only on certain operating systems. If you increase the volume capacity on a host operating system that is unsupported, the expanded capacity is unusable, and you cannot restore the original volume capacity.
====

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Volumes].
. Select the volume for which you want to increase capacity, and then select *Increase Capacity*.
+
The Confirm Increase Capacity dialog box appears.

. Select *Yes* to continue.
+
The Increase Reported Capacity dialog box appears.
+
This dialog box displays the volume's current reported capacity and the free capacity available in the volume's associated pool or volume group.

. Use the *Increase reported capacity by adding...* box to add capacity to the current available reported capacity. You can change the capacity value to display in either mebibytes (MiB), gibibytes (GiB), or tebibytes (TiB).
. Click *Increase*.

.Results

* System Manager increases the volume's capacity based on your selection.
* Select menu:Home[View Operations in Progress] to view the progress of the increase capacity operation that is currently running for the selected volume. This operation can be lengthy and could affect system performance.

.After you finish

After you expand the volume capacity, you must manually increase the file system size to match. How you do this depends on the file system you are using. See your host operating system documentation for details.
