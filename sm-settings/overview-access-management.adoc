Access Management is a method of establishing user authentication in System Manager.

== What authentication methods are available?

Authentication methods include RBAC (role-based access control), Directory Services, and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML):

 * *RBAC/Local user roles* -- Authentication is managed through RBAC capabilities enforced in the storage array. Local user roles include pre-defined user profiles and roles with specific access permissions.
 * *Directory services* -- Authentication is managed through an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server and Directory Services, such as Microsoft's Active Directory.
 * *SAML* -- Authentication is managed through an Identity Provider (IdP) using SAML 2.0.

== How do I configure authentication?

The storage array is pre-configured to use local user roles, which are an implementation of RBAC capabilities. If you want to configure a different method, go to menu:Settings[Access Management].
