[.lead]
Administrators can use RBAC (role-based access control) capabilities enforced in Unified Manager. These capabilities are referred to as "local user roles."

== Configuration workflow

Local user roles are pre-configured in the system. To use local user roles for authentication, administrators can do the following:

. An administrator logs in to Unified Manager with a user profile that includes Security admin permissions.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `admin` user has full access to all functions in the system.
====

. An administrator reviews the user profiles, which are predefined and cannot be modified.
. Optionally, the administrator assigns new passwords for each user profile.
. Users log in to the system with their assigned credentials.

== Management

When using only local user roles for authentication, administrators can perform the following management tasks:

* Change passwords.
* Set a minimum length for passwords.
* Allow users to log in without passwords.
