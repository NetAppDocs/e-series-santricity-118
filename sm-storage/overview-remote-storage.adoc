If you have the Remote Storage feature, you can import data from a remote storage system to your storage array.

== What is the Remote Storage feature?
The _Remote Storage_ feature allows you to import data from a remote storage system to a local E-Series storage system. The remote system can be another E-Series system or a system from another vendor. This feature is helpful when you want to streamline data migration with minimal downtime, such as during equipment upgrades.

NOTE: To use remote storage, this feature must be enabled in the Submodel ID (SMID).

== How do I import data with this feature?
Using the Remote Storage wizard, you map a remote storage device (the source for the data import) to a target volume on the E-Series system. This wizard is available from menu:Storage[Remote storage].
