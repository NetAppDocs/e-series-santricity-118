[.lead]
You can configure a connection to the Network Time Protocol (NTP) server so that the controller periodically queries the NTP server to update its internal time-of-day clock.

.Before you begin

* An NTP server must be installed and configured in your network.
* You must know the address of the primary NTP server and an optional backup NTP server. These addresses can be fully qualified domain names, IPv4 addresses, or IPv6 addresses.

[NOTE]
====
If you enter one or more domain names for the NTP servers, you must also configure a DNS server to resolve the NTP server address. You need to configure the DNS server only on those controllers where you configured NTP and provided a domain name.
====

.About this task

NTP enables the storage array to automatically synchronize the controller's clocks with an external host using Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP). The controller periodically queries the configured NTP server, and then uses the results to update its internal time-of-day clock. If only one controller has NTP enabled, the alternate controller periodically synchronizes its clock with the controller that has NTP enabled. If neither controller has NTP enabled, the controllers periodically synchronize their clocks with each other.

[NOTE]
====
You do not need to configure NTP on both controllers; however, doing so improves the storage array's ability to stay synchronized during hardware or communication failures.
====

.Steps

. Select *Hardware*.
. If the graphic shows the drives, click the *Controllers & Components* tab.
+
The graphic changes to show the controllers instead of the drives.

. Click the controller you want to configure.
+
The controller's context menu appears.

. Select *Configure NTP server*.
+
The Configure Network Time Protocol (NTP) Server dialog box opens.

. Select *I want to enable NTP on Controller* (*A* or *B*).
+
Additional selections appear in the dialog box.

. Select one of the following options:
 ** *Automatically obtain NTP server addresses from DHCP server* -- The detected NTP server addresses are shown.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the storage array is set to use a static NTP address, no NTP servers appear.
====

 ** *Manually specify NTP server addresses* -- Enter the primary NTP server address and a backup NTP server address. The backup server is optional. (These address fields appear after you select the radio button.) The server address can be a fully qualified domain name, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address.
. *Optional:* Enter server information and authentication credentials for a backup NTP server.
. Click *Save*.

.Results

The NTP server configuration is displayed in the controller settings, *DNS / NTP* tab.
