You can use System Manager to create Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), import certificates, and manage existing certificates.

== What are certificates?
_Certificates_ are digital files that identify online entities, such as websites and servers, for secure communications on the internet. There are two types of certificates: a _signed certificate_ is validated by a certificate authority (CA) and a _self-signed certificate_ is validated by the owner of the entity instead of a third party.

== How do I configure signed certificates?
You first generate a signing request from System Manager, and then send the file to a CA. Once the CA returns the certificate files, you import them using System Manager.
