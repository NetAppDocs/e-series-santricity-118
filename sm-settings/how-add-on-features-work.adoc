Add-ons are features that are not included in the standard configuration of System Manager and might require a key to enable. An add-on feature can be either a single premium feature or a bundled feature pack.

The following steps provide an overview for enabling a premium feature or feature pack:

. Obtain the following information:
 ** Chassis serial number and the Feature Enable Identifier, which identify the storage array for the feature to be installed. These items are available in System Manager.
 ** Feature Activation Code, which is available from the Support site when you purchase the feature.
. Obtain the feature key by contacting your storage provider or by accessing the Premium Feature Activation site. Provide the chassis serial number, enable identifier, and feature code for activation.
. Using System Manager, enable the premium feature or feature pack using the feature key file.
