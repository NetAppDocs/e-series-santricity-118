Creating a host is one of the steps required to let the storage array know which hosts are attached to it and to allow I/O access to the volumes. You can only create a host manually.

== Manual creation

Manual host creation allows you to ensure that the host port identifiers that were detected by the storage array controllers are associated correctly with the hosts.

During manual host creation, you associate host port identifiers by selecting them from a list or manually entering them. After you create a host, you can assign volumes to it or add it to a host cluster if you plan to share access to volumes.
