If the storage array includes drives with different types of physical and logical attributes, the Hardware page provides filter fields that help you limit the drive view and locate specific drives.

.About this task

The drive filters can limit the view to only certain types of physical drives (for example, all SAS), with certain security attributes (for example, secure-capable), at certain logical locations (for example, Volume Group 1). You can use these filters together or separately.

[NOTE]
====
If all drives share the same physical attributes, the *Show drives that are...* filter field does not appear. If all drives share the same logical attributes, the *Anywhere in the storage array* filter field does not appear.
====

.Steps

. Select *Hardware*.
. In the first filter field (under *Show drives that are...*), click the drop-down arrow to display the available drive types and security attributes.
+
Drive types might include:

 ** Drive media type (SSD, HDD)
 ** Drive interface type
 ** Drive capacity (highest to lowest)
 ** Drive speed (highest to lowest)
Security attributes might include:
 ** Secure-capable
 ** Secure-enabled
 ** DA (Data Assurance) capable
 ** FIPS compliant
 ** FIPS compliant (FIPS 140-2)
 ** FIPS compliant (FIPS 140-3)
+
If any of these attributes are the same for all drives, they are not shown in the drop-down list. For example, if the storage array includes all SSD drives with SAS interfaces and speeds of 15000 RPM, but some SSDs have different capacities, the drop-down list displays only the capacities as a filtering choice.
+
When you select an option from the field, the drives that do not match your filter criteria are grayed out in the graphic view.
+
. In the second filter box, click the drop-down arrow to display the available logical locations for the drives.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you need to clear your filter criteria, select *Clear* on the far right of the filter boxes.
====
+
Logical locations might include:

 ** Pools
 ** Volume Groups
 ** Hot spare
 ** SSD Cache
 ** Unassigned
+
When you select an option from the field, the drives that do not match your filter criteria are grayed out in the graphic view.

. Optionally, you can select *Turn on locator lights* at the far right of the filter fields to turn on the locator lights for the displayed drives.
+
This action helps you physically locate the drives in the storage array.
