If you are instructed to do so, you can place a controller offline.

.Before you begin

* Your storage array must have two controllers. The controller that you are not placing offline must be online (in the optimal state).
* Make sure that no volumes are in use or that you have a multipath driver installed on all hosts using these volumes.

The graphic changes to show the controllers instead of the drives.

. Click the controller that you want to place offline.
+
The controller's context menu appears.
