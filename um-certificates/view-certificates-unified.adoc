You can view summary information for a certificate, which includes the organization using the certificate, the authority that issued the certificate, the period of validity, and the fingerprints (unique identifiers).

.Before you begin

You must be logged in with a user profile that includes Security admin permissions. Otherwise, certificate functions do not appear.

.Steps

. Select *Certificate Management*.
. Select one of the following tabs:
 ** *Management* -- Shows the certificate for the system hosting the Web Services Proxy. A management certificate can be self-signed or approved by a certificate authority (CA). It allows secure access to Unified Manager.
 ** *Trusted* -- Shows certificates that Unified Manager can access for storage arrays and other remote servers, such as an LDAP server. The certificates can be issued from a certificate authority (CA) or can be self-signed.
. To see more information about a certificate, select its row, select the ellipses at the end of the row, and then click *View* or *Export*.
