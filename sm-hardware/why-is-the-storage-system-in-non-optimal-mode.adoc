A storage system in non-optimal mode is due to an Invalid System Configuration state. Despite this state, normal I/O access to existing volumes is fully supported; however, System Manager will prohibit some operations.

A storage system might transition to Invalid System Configuration for one of these reasons:

* The controller is out of compliance, possibly because it has an incorrect submodel ID (SMID) code or it has exceeded the limit of premium features.
* An internal service operation is in progress, such as a drive firmware download.
* The controller exceeded the parity error threshold and went into lockdown.
* A general lockdown condition occurred.
