The Snapshot feature allows you to create point-in-time images of storage array volumes to use for backup or testing.

== What are snapshot images?
A _snapshot image_ is a logical copy of volume data, captured at a particular point-in-time. Like a restore point, snapshot images allow you to roll back to a known good data set. Although the host can access the snapshot image, it cannot directly read or write to it.

== How do I create snapshots?
You can manually create a snapshot image from a base volume or snapshot consistency group. This procedure is available from menu:Storage[Snapshots].

== How do I roll back data from a snapshot?
A _rollback_ is the process of returning data in a base volume to a previous point in time. You can roll back snapshot data from menu:Storage[Snapshots].
