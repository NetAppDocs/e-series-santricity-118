You can change the user passwords for each user in Access Management.

.Before you begin

* You must be logged in as the local administrator, which includes Root admin permissions.
* You must know the local administrator password.

.About this task

Keep these guidelines in mind when choosing a password:

* Any new local user passwords must meet or exceed the current setting for a minimum password (in View/Edit Settings).
* Passwords are case sensitive.
* Trailing spaces are not removed from passwords when they are set. Be careful to include spaces if they were included in the password.
* For increased security, use at least 15 alphanumeric characters and change the password frequently.

.Steps

. Select *Access Management*.
. Select the *Local User Roles* tab.
. Select a user from the table.
+
The Change Password button becomes available.

. Select *Change Password*.
+
The Change Password dialog box opens.

. If no minimum password length is set for local user passwords, you can select the checkbox to require the user to enter a password to access the system.
. Enter the new password for the selected user in the two fields.
. Enter your local administrator password to confirm this operation, and then click *Change*.

.Results

If the user is currently logged in, the password change causes the user's active session to terminate.
