You can change the settings for the syslog server used for archiving audit logs, and also upload a new Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the server.

.Before you begin

* You must be logged in with a user profile that includes Security admin permissions. Otherwise, the Access Management functions do not appear.
* The syslog server address, protocol, and port number must be available. The server address can be a fully qualified domain name, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6 address.
* If you are uploading a new CA certificate, the certificate must be available on your local system.

.Steps

. Select menu:Settings[Access Management].
. From the Audit Log tab, select *Configure Syslog Servers*.
+
Configured syslog servers are displayed on the page.

. To edit the server information, select the *Edit* (pencil) icon to the right of the server name, and then make desired changes in the following fields:
 ** *Server Address* -- Enter a fully qualified domain name, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6 address.
 ** *Protocol* -- Select a protocol from the drop-down list (for example, TLS, UDP, or TCP).
 ** *Port* -- Enter the port number for the syslog receiver.
. If you changed the protocol to the secure TLS protocol (from either UDP or TCP), click *Import Trusted Certificate* to upload a CA certificate.
. To test the new connection with the storage array, select *Test All*.

.Results

After configuration, all new audit logs are sent to the syslog server. Previous logs are not transferred.
