Volumes used for imports must meet the requirements for size, status, and other criteria.

== Remote storage volume

The source volume of an import is called a "remote storage volume." This volume must meet the following criteria:

* Cannot be part of another import
* Must have an online status

After the import begins, the controller firmware creates a remote storage volume in the background. Due to that background process, the remote storage volume is not manageable in System Manager and can only be used for the import operation.

After it is created, the remote storage volume is treated like any other standard volume on the E-Series system with the following exceptions:

* Can be used as proxies to the remote storage device.
* Cannot be used as candidates for other volume copies or snapshots.
* Cannot have the Data Assurance setting changed while the import is in progress.
* Cannot be mapped to any hosts, because they are reserved strictly for the import operation.

Each remote storage volume is associated with only one remote storage object; however, one remote storage object can be associated with multiple remote storage volumes. The remote storage volume is uniquely identified using a combination of the following:

* Remote storage object identifier
* Remote storage device LUN number

== Target volume candidates

The target volume is the destination volume on the local E-Series system. The destination volume must meet the following criteria:

* Must be a RAID/DDP volume.
* Must have a capacity that is equal to or larger than the remote storage volume.
* Must have a block size that is the same as the remote storage volume.
* Must have a valid state (optimal).
* Cannot have any of the following relationships: volume copy, snapshot copies, asynchronous or synchronous mirroring.
* Cannot be undergoing any reconfiguration operations: Dynamic Volume Expansion, Dynamic Capacity Expansion, Dynamic Segment Size, Dynamic RAID Migration, Dynamic Capacity Reduction, or Defragmentation.
* Cannot be mapped to a host before the import starts (however, it can be mapped after import completes).
* Cannot have Flash Read Cached (FRC) enabled.

System Manager automatically checks these requirements as part of the Import Remote Storage wizard. Only volumes that meet all the requirements are displayed for destination volume selection.
