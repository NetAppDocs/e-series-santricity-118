You can monitor thin volumes for space and generate appropriate alerts to prevent out-of-capacity conditions.

Thin-provisioned environments can allocate more logical space than they have underlying physical storage. You can select menu:Storage[Volumes > Thin Volume Monitoring] tab to monitor how much growth your thin volumes have before they reach the allocated capacity maximum limit.

You can use the Thin Monitoring view to perform the following actions:

* Define the limit that restricts the allocated capacity to which a thin volume can automatically expand.
* Set the percentage point at which an alert (warning threshold exceeded) is sent to the Notifications area on the Home page when a thin volume is near the maximum allocated capacity limit.

To increase capacity for a thin volume, increase its reported capacity.

[NOTE]
====
System Manager does not provide an option to create thin volumes. If you want to create thin volumes, use the Command Line Interface (CLI).

[NOTE]

Thin volumes are not available on the EF600 or EF300 storage system.
