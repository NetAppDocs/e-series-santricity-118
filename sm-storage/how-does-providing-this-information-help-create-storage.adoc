The workload information is used to optimize the volume characteristics such as I/O type, segment size, and read/write cache for the workload selected. These optimized characteristics dictate how your workload interacts with the storage array components.

Based on the workload information you provide, System Manager creates the appropriate volumes and places them on the available pools or volume groups that currently exist on the system. The system creates the volumes and optimizes their characteristics based on the current best practices for the workload you selected.

Before you finish creating volumes for a given workload, you can review the recommended volume configuration and edit, add, or delete the system-recommended volumes and characteristics using the Add/Edit Volumes dialog box.

Refer to your application-specific documentation for best practice information.
