To break the connection between a directory server and the Web Services Proxy, you can remove the server information from the Access Management page. You might want to perform this task if you configured a new server, and then want to remove the old one.

.Before you begin

You must be logged in with a user profile that includes Security admin permissions. Otherwise, the Access Management functions do not appear.

.About this task

After you complete this task, any active user sessions are terminated. Only your current user session is retained.

.Steps

. Select *Access Management*.
. Select the *Directory Services* tab.
. From the list, select the directory server you want to delete.
. Click *Remove*.
+
The Remove Directory Server dialog box opens.

. Type `remove` in the field, and then click *Remove*.
+
The directory server configuration settings, privilege settings, and role mappings are removed. Users can no longer log in with credentials from this server.
