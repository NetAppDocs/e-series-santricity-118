. In the *Name* field, type a name for the new group.
. Select the storage arrays that you want to add to the new group.
. Click *Create*.

== Step 2: Add storage array to group
You can add one or more storage arrays to a user-created group.

.Steps

. From the main view, select *Manage*, and then select the group that you want to add storage arrays to.
. Select menu:Manage Groups[Add storage arrays to group].
. Select the storage arrays that you want to add to the group.
. Click *Add.*
