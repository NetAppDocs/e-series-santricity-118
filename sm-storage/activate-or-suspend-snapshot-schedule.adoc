You can temporarily suspend scheduled collection of snapshot images when you need to conserve storage space. This method is more efficient than deleting and later re-creating the snapshot schedule.

.About this task

The state of the snapshot schedule stays suspended until you use the *Activate* option to resume scheduled snapshot activity.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Snapshots].
. If it is not already displayed, click the *Schedules* tab.
+
The schedules are listed on the page.

. Select an active snapshot schedule that you want to suspend, and then click *Activate / Suspend*.
+
The State column status changes to *Suspended*, and the snapshot schedule stops collection of all snapshot images.

. To resume collecting snapshot images, select the suspended snapshot schedule that you want to resume, and then click *Activate / Suspend*.
+
The State column status changes to *Active*.
