When the storage array sends alerts, it does not correct for the time zone of the target server or host that receives the alerts. Instead, the storage array uses the local time (GMT) to create the timestamp used for the alert record. As a result, you might see inconsistencies between the timestamps for the storage array and the server or host receiving an alert.

Because the storage array does not correct for time zone when sending alerts, the timestamp on the alerts is GMT-relative, which has a time-zone offset of zero. To calculate a timestamp appropriate to your local time zone, you should determine your hour offset from GMT, and then add or subtract that value from the timestamps.
