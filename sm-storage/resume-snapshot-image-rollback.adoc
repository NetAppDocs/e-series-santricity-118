If an error occurs during a snapshot image rollback operation, the operation is automatically paused. You can resume a rollback operation that is in a paused state.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Snapshots].
. Click the *Snapshot Images* tab.
. Highlight the paused rollback, and then select menu:Rollback[Resume].
+
The operation resumes.

.Results

System Manager performs the following actions:

* If the rollback operation resumes successfully, you can view the progress of the rollback operation in the Operations in Progress window.
* If the rollback operation is not successful, the operation pauses again. You can follow the Recovery Guru procedure to correct the problem or contact technical support.
