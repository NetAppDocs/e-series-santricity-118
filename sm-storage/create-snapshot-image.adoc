[.lead]
You can manually create a snapshot image from a base volume or snapshot consistency group. This is also called an _instant snapshot_ or _instant image_.

.Before you begin

* The base volume must be optimal.
* The drive must be optimal.
* The snapshot group cannot be designated as "`reserved.`"
* The reserved capacity volume must have the same Data Assurance (DA) settings as the associated base volume for the snapshot group.

.Steps

. Do one of the following actions to create a snapshot image:
  ** Select menu:Storage[Volumes]. Select the object (base volume or snapshot consistency group), and then select menu:Copy Services[Create instant snapshot].
  ** Select menu:Storage[Snapshots]. Select the *Snapshot Images* tab, and then select menu:Create[Instant snapshot].
+
The Create Snapshot Image dialog box appears. Select the object (base volume or snapshot consistency group), and then click *Next*. If a previous snapshot image was created for the volume or snapshot consistency group, then the system creates the instant snapshot immediately. Otherwise, if this is the first time a snapshot image is created for the volume or snapshot consistency group, the Confirm Create Snapshot Image dialog box appears.
. Click *Create* to accept the notification that reserved capacity is needed and to proceed to the Reserve Capacity step.
+
The Reserve Capacity dialog box appears.

. Use the spinner box to adjust the capacity percentage, and then click *Next* to accept the candidate volume highlighted in the table.
+
The Edit Settings dialog box appears.

. Select the settings for the snapshot image as appropriate, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.

Snapshot image limit

Keep the check box selected if you want snapshot images automatically deleted after the specified limit; use the spinner box to change the limit. If you clear this check box, snapshot image creation stops after 32 images.

*Reserved capacity settings*

Alert me when...
a|
Use the spinner box to adjust the percentage point at which the system sends an alert notification when the reserved capacity for a snapshot group is nearing full.

When the reserved capacity for the snapshot group exceeds the specified threshold, use the advance notice to increase reserved capacity or to delete unnecessary objects before the remaining space runs out.
a|
Policy for full reserved capacity
a|
Choose one of the following policies:

** *Purge oldest snapshot image* -- The system automatically purges the oldest snapshot image in the snapshot group, which releases the snapshot image reserved capacity for reuse within the group.
** *Reject writes to base volume* -- When the reserved capacity reaches its maximum defined percentage, the system rejects any I/O write request to the base volume that triggered the reserved capacity access.

.Results

* System Manager displays the new snapshot image in the Snapshot Images table. The table lists the new image by timestamp and associated base volume or snapshot consistency group.
* Snapshot creation might remain in a Pending state because of the following conditions:
 ** The base volume that contains this snapshot image is a member of an asynchronous mirror group.
 ** The base volume is currently in a synchronization operation. The snapshot image creation completes as soon as the synchronization operation is complete.
