After creating a security key, you should validate the key file to make sure it is not corrupt.

If the validation fails, do the following:

* If the security key identifier does not match the identifier on the controller, locate the correct security key file and then try the validation again.
* If the controller cannot decrypt the security key for validation, you might have incorrectly entered the pass phrase. Double-check the pass phrase, re-enter it if necessary, and then try the validation again. If the error message appears again, select a backup of the key file (if available) and re-try validation.
* If you still cannot validate the security key, the original file might be corrupted. Create a new backup of the key and validate that copy.
