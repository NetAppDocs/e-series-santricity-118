The Synchronous Mirroring feature provides online, real-time data replication between storage arrays over a remote distance.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is not available on the EF600 or EF300 storage system.

== What is synchronous mirroring?
_Synchronous mirroring_ replicates data volumes in real time to ensure continuous availability. Storage array controllers manage the mirroring operation, which is transparent to host machines and software applications.

This type of mirroring is ideal for business continuity purposes such as disaster recovery.

== How do I configure synchronous mirroring?
You must use the Unified Manager interface to perform the initial mirroring configuration between the arrays. Once it is configured, you can manage mirrored pairs in System Manager.
