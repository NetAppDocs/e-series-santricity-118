If instructed to do so, you can manually fail a drive.

.About this task

System Manager monitors the drives in the storage array. When it detects that a drive is generating a lot of errors, the Recovery Guru notifies you of an impending drive failure. If this happens and you have a replacement drive available, you might want to fail the drive to take preemptive action. If you do not have a replacement drive available, you can wait for the drive to fail on its own.

[CAUTION]
====
*Possible loss of data access* -- This operation could result in data loss or the loss of data redundancy. Perform this operation only when instructed to do so by technical support or the Recovery Guru.
====

.Steps

. Select *Hardware*.
. If the graphic shows the controllers, click the *Drives* tab.
+
The graphic changes to show the drives instead of the controllers.

. Click the drive that you want to fail.
+
The drive's context menu appears.

. Select *Fail*.
. Keep the *Copy contents of drive before failing* check box selected.
+
The copy option appears only for assigned drives and for non-RAID 0 volume groups.
+
Before you fail the drive, make sure that you copy the drive's contents. Depending on your configuration, you could potentially lose all data or data redundancy on the associated pool or volume group if you do not copy the drive's contents first.
+
The copy option allows faster drive recovery than reconstruction and reduces the possibility of a volume failure if another drive were to fail during the copy operation.

. Confirm that you want to fail the drive.
+
After the drive has failed, wait at least 30 seconds before you remove it.
