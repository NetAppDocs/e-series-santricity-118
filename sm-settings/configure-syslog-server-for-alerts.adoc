To configure syslog alerts, you must enter a syslog server address and a UDP port. Up to five syslog servers are allowed. 

.Before you begin

* The syslog server address must be available. This address can be a fully qualified domain name, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6 address.
* UDP port number of the syslog server must be available. This port is typically 514.

.About this task

This task describes how to enter the address and port for the syslog server, and then test the address you entered.

.Steps

. Select menu:Settings[Alerts].
. Select the *Syslog* tab.
+
If a syslog server is not yet defined, the Alerts page displays "Add Syslog Servers."

. Click *Add Syslog Servers*.
+
The Add Syslog Server dialog box opens.

. Enter information for one or more syslog servers (maximum of five), and then click *Add*.
 ** *Server Address* -- Enter a fully qualified domain name, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6 address.
 ** *UDP Port* -- Typically, the UDP port for syslog is 514.
The table displays the configured syslog servers.
. To send a test alert to the server addresses, select *Test All Syslog Servers*.

.Results

The event monitor sends alerts to the syslog server whenever an alertable event occurs. To further configure syslog settings for audit logs, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/e-series-santricity/sm-settings/configure-syslog-server-for-audit-logs.html[Configure syslog server for audit logs].

NOTE: If multiple syslog servers are configured, all configured syslog servers will receive an audit log.
