When you make certain changes in System Manager, such as switching the management interface or using SAML for an authentication method, some external tools and features might be restricted from use.

== Management interface

Tools that communicate directly with the legacy management interface (SYMbol), such as the SANtricity SMI-S Provider or OnCommand Insight (OCI), do not work unless the Legacy Management Interface setting is enabled. In addition, you cannot use legacy CLI commands or perform mirroring operations if this setting is disabled.

Contact technical support for more information.

== SAML authentication

When SAML is enabled, the following clients cannot access storage array services and resources:

* Enterprise Management Window (EMW)
* Command-line interface (CLI)
* Software Developer Kits (SDK) clients
* In-band clients
* HTTP Basic Authentication REST API clients
* Login using standard REST API endpoint

Contact technical support for more information.
