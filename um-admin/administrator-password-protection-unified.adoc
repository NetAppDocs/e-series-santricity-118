You must configure Unified Manager with an administrator password to protect it from unauthorized access.

== Admin password and user profiles

When you start Unified Manager for the first time, you are prompted to set an administrator password. Any user who has the admin password can make configuration changes to the storage arrays.

In addition to the admin password, the Unified Manager interface includes pre-configured user profiles with one or more roles mapped to them. For more information, see link:../um-certificates/how-access-management-works-unified.html[How Access Management works].

The users and mappings cannot be changed. Only passwords can be modified. To change passwords, see:

* link:change-admin-password-unified.html[Change the admin password]
* link:../um-certificates/change-passwords-unified.html[Change passwords for local user profiles]


== Session timeouts

The software prompts you for the password only once during a single management session. A session times out after 30 minutes of inactivity by default, at which time, you must enter the password again. If another user accesses the software from another management client and changes the password while your session is in progress, you are prompted for a password the next time you attempt a configuration operation or a view operation.

For security reasons, you can attempt to enter a password only five times before the software enters a "lockout" state. In this state, the software rejects subsequent password attempts. You must wait 10 minutes to reset to a "normal" state before you try to enter a password again.

You can adjust session timeouts or you can disable session timeouts altogether. For more information, see link:manage-session-timeouts-unified.html[Manage session timeouts].
