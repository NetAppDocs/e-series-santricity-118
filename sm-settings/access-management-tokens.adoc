Access tokens provide a method of authentication with the REST API or command line interface (CLI), without exposing user names and passwords. A token is associated to a specific user (including LDAP users), and includes a set of permissions and an expiration.

== SAML and JSON web token access
By default, a system with SAML enabled does not allow access to traditional command line tools. The REST API and CLI effectively become inoperable because the MFA workflow requires a redirect to an Identity Provider server for authentication. Therefore, you must generate tokens in System Manager, which mandates that a user is authenticated via MFA.

NOTE: It is not necessary to have SAML enabled to use web tokens, but SAML is recommended for the highest level of security.

== Workflow for creating and using tokens

. Create a token in System Manager and determine its expiration.

. Copy the token text to the clipboard or download it to a file, and then save the token text in a secure location.

. Use the token as follows:

* *Rest API*: To use a token in a REST API request, add an HTTP header to your requests. For example:
`Authorization: Bearer _<access-token-value>_`
* *Secure CLI*: To use a token in the CLI, add the token value on the command line or use the path to a file containing the token value. For example:
+
** Token value on the command line: `-t _access-token-value_`
** Path to a file containing the token value: `-T _access-token-file_`
