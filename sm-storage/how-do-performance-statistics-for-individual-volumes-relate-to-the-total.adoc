The statistics for pools and volume groups are calculated by aggregating all volumes, including reserved capacity volumes.

Reserved capacity is used internally by the storage system to support thin volumes, snapshots, and asynchronous mirroring, and are not visible to I/O hosts. As a result, the pool, controller, and storage array statistics may not add up to be the sum of the viewable volumes.

However, for application and workload statistics, only the visible volumes are aggregated.
