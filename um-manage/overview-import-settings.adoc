The Import Settings feature allows you to perform a batch operation for importing the settings from one array to multiple arrays. This feature saves time when you need to configure multiple arrays in the network.

== What settings can be imported?
You can import alerting methods, AutoSupport configurations, Directory Services configurations, storage configurations (such as volume groups and pools), and system settings (such as automatic load balancing).
