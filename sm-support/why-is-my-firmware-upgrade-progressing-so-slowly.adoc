The firmware upgrade progress depends on the overall load of the system.

During an online upgrade of drive firmware, if a volume transfer takes place during the rapid reconstruction process, the system initiates a full reconstruction on the volume that was transferred. This operation might take a considerable amount of time. Actual full reconstruction time depends on several factors, including the amount of I/O activity occurring during the reconstruction operation, the number of drives in the volume group, the rebuild priority setting, and the drive performance.
