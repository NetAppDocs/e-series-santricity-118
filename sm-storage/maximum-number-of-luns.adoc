The storage array has a maximum number of logical unit numbers (LUNs) that can be used for each host.

The maximum number depends on the operating system of the host. The storage array tracks the number of LUNs used. If you try to assign a volume to a host that exceeds the maximum number of LUNs, the host cannot access the volume.
