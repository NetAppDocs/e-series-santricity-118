[.lead]
If you are instructed to do so, you can place a controller in service mode.

.Before you begin

* The storage array must have two controllers. The controller that you are not placing in service mode must be online (in the optimal state).
* Make sure that no volumes are in use or that you have a multipath driver installed on all hosts using these volumes.

[NOTE]
====
Placing a controller in service mode might significantly reduce performance. Do not place a controller in service mode unless you are instructed to do so by technical support.
