Mirroring is configured in the SANtricity Unified Manager interface.

[NOTE]
====
Synchronous mirroring is not available on the EF600 or EF300 storage array.
====


To enable and configure mirroring between two arrays, verify the following:

* The Web Services Proxy service must be running. (Unified Manager is installed on a host system along with the Web Services Proxy.)
* Unified Manager must be running on your local host through an HTTPS connection.
* The two storage arrays you want to use for mirroring must be discovered in Unified Manager.
* Unified Manager must have valid SSL certificates for the storage arrays. You can accept a self-signed certificate or install CA-signed certificates from Unified Manager.

For configuration instructions, see the following:

* link:../um-manage/create-asynchronous-mirrored-pair-um.html[Create asynchronous mirrored pair (in Unified Manager)]
* link:../um-manage/create-synchronous-mirrored-pair-um.html[Create synchronous mirrored pair (in Unified Manager)]
