`+http[s]://<server>:<port>/um+`
+
In this URL, `<server>` represents the IP address or FQDN of the server where the Web Services Proxy is installed, and `<port>` represents the listening port number (defaults to 8080 for HTTP or 8443 for HTTPS).
+
The Unified Manager login page opens.

. For first-time login, enter `admin` for the user name, and then set and confirm a password for the admin user.

The password can include up to 30 characters.
