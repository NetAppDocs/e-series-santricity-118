[.lead]
Use the Clear Configuration operation when you want to delete all the pools, volume groups, volumes, host definitions, and host assignments from the storage array.

.Before you begin

Before clearing the storage array configuration, back up the data.

.About this task

There are two Clear Storage Array Configuration options:

* *Volume* -- Typically, you might use the Volume option to reconfigure a test storage array as a production storage array. For example, you might configure a storage array for testing, and then, when you are done testing, remove the test configuration and set up the storage array for a production environment.
* *Storage Array* -- Typically, you might use the Storage Array option to move a storage array to another department or group. For example, you might be using a storage array in Engineering, and now Engineering is getting a new storage array, so you want to move the current storage array to Administration where it will be reconfigured.
+
The Storage Array option deletes some additional settings.
