[.lead]
You discover multiple arrays to detect all storage arrays across the subnet where the management server resides and to automatically add the discovered arrays to your management domain.

.Before you begin

* You must be logged in with a user profile that includes Security Admin permissions.
* The storage array must be correctly set up and configured.
* Storage array passwords must be set up using System Manager's Access Management tile.
* To resolve untrusted certificates, you must have trusted certificate files from a Certificate Authority (CA), and the certificate files are available on your local system.

Discovering arrays is a multi-step procedure.

== Step 1: Enter network address
You enter a network address range to search across the local sub-network. Any storage array successfully reached appears on the Discover page and might be added to your management domain.

If you need to stop the discovery operation for any reason, click *Stop Discovery*.

.Steps

. From the Manage page, select *Add/Discover*.
+
The Add/Discover dialog box appears.

. Select the *Discover all storage arrays within a network range* radio button.
. Enter the starting network address and ending network address to search across your local sub-network, and then click *Start Discovery*.
+
The discovery process starts. This discovery process can take several minutes to complete. The table on the Discover page is populated as the storage arrays are discovered.
+
[NOTE]
====
If no manageable arrays are discovered, verify that the storage arrays are properly connected to your network and their assigned addresses are within range. Click *New Discovery Parameters* to return to the Add/Discover page.
====

. Review the list of discovered storage arrays.
. Select the checkbox next to any storage array that you want to add to your management domain, and then click *Next*.
+
Unified Manager performs a credential check on each array you are adding to the management domain. You might need to resolve any self-signed certificates and untrusted certificates associated with that array.

. Click *Next* to proceed to the next step in the wizard.

== Step 2: Resolve self-signed certificates during discovery

As part of the discovery process, the system verifies that the storage arrays are using certificates by a trusted source.

.Steps

. Do one of the following:
 ** If you trust the connections to the discovered storage arrays, continue to the next card in the wizard. The self-signed certificates will be marked as trusted and the storage arrays will be added to Unified Manager.
 ** If you do not trust the connections to the storage arrays, select *Cancel* and validate each storage array's security certificate strategy before adding any of them to Unified Manager.
. Click *Next* to proceed to the next step in the wizard.

== Step 3: Resolve untrusted certificates during discovery

Untrusted certificates occur when a storage array attempts to establish a secure connection to Unified Manager, but the connection fails to confirm as secure. During the array discovery process, you can resolve untrusted certificates by importing a certificate authority (CA) certificate (or CA-signed certificate) that has been issued by a trusted third party.

You may need to install additional trusted CA certificates if any of the following are true:

* You recently added a storage array.
* One or both certificates are expired.
* One or both certificates are revoked.
* One or both certificates are missing a root or intermediate certificate.

.Steps

. Select the check box next to any storage array that you want to resolve untrusted certificates for, and then select the **Import** button.
+
A dialog box opens for importing the trusted certificate files.

. Click *Browse* to select the certificate files for the storage arrays.
+
The file names display in the dialog box.

. Click *Import*.
+
The files are uploaded and validated.
+
[NOTE]
====
Any storage array with untrusted certificate issues that are unresolved will not be added to Unified Manager.
====

. Click *Next* to proceed to the next step in the wizard.

== Step 4: Provide passwords
You must enter the passwords for the storage arrays that you want to add to your management domain.

.Before you begin

.Steps

. Enter the password for each storage array you want to add to Unified Manager.
. *Optional:* Associate storage arrays to a group: From the drop-down list, select the desired group to associate with the selected storage arrays.
. Click *Finish*.

.After you finish

The storage arrays are added to your management domain and associated with the selected group (if specified).

[NOTE]
====
It can take several minutes for Unified Manager to connect to the specified storage arrays.
