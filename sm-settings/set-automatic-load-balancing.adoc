The Automatic Load Balancing feature ensures that incoming I/O traffic from the hosts is dynamically managed and balanced across both controllers. This feature is enabled by default, but you can disable it from System Manager.

.About this task

When Automatic Load Balancing is enabled, it performs the following functions:

* Automatically monitors and balances controller resource utilization.
* Automatically adjusts volume controller ownership when needed, thereby optimizing I/O bandwidth between the hosts and the storage array.

You might want to disable Automatic Load Balancing on your storage array for the following reasons:

* You do not want to automatically change a particular volume's controller ownership to balance workload.
* You are operating in a highly tuned environment where load distribution is purposefully set up to achieve a specific distribution between the controllers.

.Steps

. Select menu:Settings[System].
. Scroll down to *Additional Settings*, and then click *Enable/Disable Automatic Load Balancing*.
+
The text below this option indicates whether the feature is currently enabled or disabled.
+
A confirmation dialog box opens.

. Confirm by clicking *Yes* to continue.
+
By selecting this option, you toggle the feature between enabled/disabled.

[NOTE]
====
If this feature is moved from disabled to enabled, the Host Connectivity Reporting feature is automatically enabled as well.
