A host bus adapter (HBA) is a board that resides in a host and contains one or more host ports. A host port is a port on a host bus adapter (HBA) that provides the physical connection to a controller and is used for I/O operations.

The adapter ports on the HBA are called host ports. Most HBAs have either one or two host ports. The HBA has a unique World Wide Identifier (WWID), and each HBA host port has a unique WWID. The host port identifiers are used to associate the appropriate HBA with the physical host when you are manually creating the host through SANtricity System Manager.
