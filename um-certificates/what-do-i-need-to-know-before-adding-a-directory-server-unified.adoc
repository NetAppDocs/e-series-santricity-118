Before adding a directory server in Access Management, you must meet certain requirements.

* User groups must be defined in your directory service.
* LDAP server credentials must be available, including the domain name, server URL, and optionally the bind account user name and password.
* For LDAPS servers using a secure protocol, the LDAP server's certificate chain must be installed on your local machine.
