You can use Unified Manager to import settings from one storage array to multiple storage arrays. The Import Settings feature is a batch operation that saves time when you need to configure multiple arrays in the network.

== Settings available for import

The following configurations can be imported to multiple arrays:

* *Alerts* -- Alerting methods to send important events to administrators, using email, a syslog server, or an SNMP server.
* *AutoSupport* -- A feature that monitors the health of a storage array and sends automatic dispatches to technical support.
* *Directory services* -- A method of user authentication that is managed through an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server and directory service, such as Microsoft's Active Directory.
* *Storage configuration* -- Configurations relating to the following:
 ** Volumes (thick and non-repository volumes only)
 ** Volume groups and pools
 ** Hot spare drive assignments
* *System settings* -- Configurations relating to the following:
 ** Media scan settings for a volume
 ** SSD settings
 ** Automatic load balancing (does not include host connectivity reporting)

== Configuration workflow

To import settings, follow this workflow:

. On a storage array to be used as the source, configure the settings using System Manager.
. On the storage arrays to be used as the targets, back up their configuration using System Manager.
. From Unified Manager, go to the *Manage* page and import the settings.
. From the *Operations* page, review the results of the Import Settings operation.
