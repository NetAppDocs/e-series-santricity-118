You can revoke all access tokens if you determine that a token has been compromised or if you want to perform a manual key rotation for the cryptographic keys used to sign and validate the access tokens.

This operation regenerates the keys used to sign the tokens. Once the keys are reset, _all_ issued tokens are immediately invalidated. Because the storage array does not track tokens, individual tokens cannot be revoked.

.Steps

. Select menu:Settings[Access Management].
. Select the *Access Tokens* tab.
. Select *Revoke All Access Tokens*.
. In the dialog box, click *Yes*.

After revoking all tokens, you can create new tokens and use them immediately.
