You can check component status on the Hardware page and perform some functions related to those components.

== Which components can I manage?
You can check component status and perform some functions related to these components:

* **Shelves** -- A _shelf_ is a component that contains the hardware for the storage array (controllers, power/fan canisters, and drives). Shelves are available in three sizes for housing up to 12, 24, or 60 drives.

* **Controllers** -- A _controller_ is the combined hardware and firmware that implements storage array and management functions. It includes the cache memory, drive support, and the ports for host connections.

* **Drives** -- A _drive_ can be either a hard disk drive (HDD) or a solid state drive (SSD). Depending on the shelf size, up to 12, 24, or 60 drives can be installed in the shelf.

== How do I view hardware components?
Go to the Hardware page, which provides a graphical depiction of the storage array's physical components. You can switch between the front and back views of the array shelves by selecting either the *Drives* or *Controllers* tab from the upper right of the shelf view.
