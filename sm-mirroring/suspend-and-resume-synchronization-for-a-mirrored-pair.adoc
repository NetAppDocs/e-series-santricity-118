You can use the Suspend option and Resume option to control when to synchronize the data on the primary volume and the secondary volume in a mirrored pair.

.About this task

If a mirrored pair is manually suspended, the mirrored pair will not synchronize until it is manually resumed.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Synchronous Mirroring].
. Select the mirrored pair that you want to suspend or resume, and then select either menu:More[Suspend] or menu:More[Resume].
+
The system displays a confirmation.

. Select *Yes* to confirm.

.Results

System Manager performs the following actions:

* Either suspends or resumes data transfer between the mirrored pair without removing the mirror relationship.
* For a _suspended_ mirrored pair:
 ** Displays *Suspended* in the Mirrored Pair table.
 ** Logs any data that was written to the primary volume of the mirrored pair while synchronization is suspended.
* For a _resumed_ mirrored pair, writes the data automatically to the secondary volume of the mirrored pair when synchronization is resumed. A full synchronization is not required.
