You can configure System Manager to send storage array alerts by email, SNMP traps, and syslog messages.

== What are alerts?
_Alerts_ notify administrators about important events that occur on the storage array. Events can include such issues as a battery failure, a component moving from Optimal to Offline, or redundancy errors in the controller. All Critical events are considered "alertable," along with some Warning and Informational events.

== How do I configure alerts?
You can configure alerts to be sent as a message to one or more email addresses, as an SNMP trap to an SNMP server, or as a message to a syslog server. Alert configuration is available from menu:Settings[Alerts].
