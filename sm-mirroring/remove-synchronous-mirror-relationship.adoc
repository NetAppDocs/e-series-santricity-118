[.lead]
You remove a mirrored pair to remove the mirror relationship from the primary volume on the local storage array and the secondary volume on the remote storage array.

.About this task

You can also remove a mirrored pair to correct an orphaned mirrored pair state. Review the following information about orphaned mirrored pairs:

* An orphaned mirrored pair exists when a member volume has been removed on one side (local/remote) but not on the other side.
* Orphaned mirrored pairs are detected when inter-array communication is restored.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Synchronous Mirroring].
. Select the mirrored pair that you want to remove, and then select the menu:Uncommon Tasks[Remove].
+
The Remove Mirror Relationship dialog box appears.

. Confirm that you want to remove the mirrored pair, and then click *Remove*.

.Results

System Manager performs the following actions:

* Removes the mirror relationship from the mirrored pair on the local storage array and on the remote storage array.
* Returns the primary volume and the secondary volume to host-accessible, non-mirrored volumes.
* Updates the Synchronous Mirroring tile with the removal of the synchronous mirrored pair.
