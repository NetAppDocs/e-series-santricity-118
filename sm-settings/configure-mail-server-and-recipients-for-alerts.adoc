To configure email alerts, you must specify a mail server address and the email addresses of the alert recipients. Up to 20 email addresses are allowed.

.Before you begin

* The address of the mail server must be available. The address can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address, or a fully qualified domain name.
+
[NOTE]
====
To use a fully qualified domain name, you must configure a DNS server on both controllers. You can configure a DNS server from the Hardware page.
====

* Email address to be used as the alert sender must be available. This is the address that appears in the "From" field of the alert message. A sender address is required in the SMTP protocol; without it, an error results.
* Email address(es) of the alert recipient(s) must be available. The recipient is typically an address for a network administrator or storage administrator. You can enter up to 20 email addresses.
