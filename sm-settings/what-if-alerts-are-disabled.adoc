If you want administrators to receive notifications about important events that occur in the storage array, you must configure an alerting method.

For storage arrays managed with SANtricity System Manager, you configure alerts from the Alerts page. Alert notifications can be sent through email, SNMP traps, or syslog messages. In addition, email alerts can be configured from the Initial Setup Wizard.
