[.lead]
You can delete a pool or volume group to create more unassigned capacity, which you can reconfigure to meet your application storage needs.

.Before you begin

* You must have backed up the data on all of the volumes in the pool or volume group.
* You must have stopped all input/output (I/O).
* You must unmount any file systems on the volumes.
* You must have deleted any mirror relationships in the pool or volume group.
* You must have stopped any volume copy operation in progress for the pool or volume group.
* The pool or volume group must not be participating in an asynchronous mirroring operation.
* The drives in the volume group must not have a persistent reservation.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Pools & Volume Groups].
. Select one pool or volume group from the list.
+
You can select only one pool or volume group at a time. Scroll down the list to see additional pools or volume groups.

. Select menu:Uncommon Tasks[Delete] and confirm.

.Results

System Manager performs the following actions:

* Deletes all of the data in the pool or volume group.
* Deletes all the drives associated with the pool or volume group.
* Unassigns the associated drives, which allows you to reuse them in new or existing pools or volume groups.
