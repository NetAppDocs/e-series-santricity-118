You must assign a volume to a host or a host cluster so it can be used for I/O operations. This assignment grants a host or host cluster access to one or more volumes in a storage array.

.About this task

Keep these guidelines in mind when you assign volumes to hosts:

* You can assign a volume to only one host or host cluster at a time.
* Assigned volumes are shared between controllers in the storage array.
* The same logical unit number (LUN) cannot be used twice by a host or a host cluster to access a volume. You must use a unique LUN.
* For new volume groups, if you wait until all volumes are created and initialized before you assign them to a host, the volume initialization time is reduced. Keep in mind that once a volume associated with the volume group is mapped, _all_ volumes will revert to the slower initialization. You can check the initialization progress from menu:Home[Operations in Progress].

Assigning a volume fails under these conditions:

* All volumes are assigned.
* The volume is already assigned to another host or host cluster.

The ability to assign a volume is unavailable under these conditions:

* No valid hosts or host clusters exist.
* No host port identifiers have been defined for the host.
* All volume assignments have been defined.

All unassigned volumes are displayed during this task, but functions for hosts with or without Data Assurance (DA) apply as follows:

* For a DA-capable host, you can select volumes that are either DA-enabled or not DA-enabled.
* For a host that is not DA-capable, if you select a volume that is DA-enabled, a warning states that the system must automatically turn off DA on the volume before assigning the volume to the host.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Hosts].
. Select the host or host cluster to which you want to assign volumes, and then click *Assign Volumes*.
+
A dialog box appears that lists all the volumes that can be assigned. You can sort any of the columns or type something in the *Filter* box to make it easier to find particular volumes.

. Select the check box next to each volume that you want to assign or select the check box in the table header to select all volumes.
. Click *Assign* to complete the operation.

.Results

After successfully assigning a volume or volumes to a host or a host cluster, the system performs the following actions:

* The assigned volume receives the next available LUN number. The host uses the LUN number to access the volume.
* The user-supplied volume name appears in volume listings associated to the host. If applicable, the factory-configured access volume also appears in volume listings associated to the host.
