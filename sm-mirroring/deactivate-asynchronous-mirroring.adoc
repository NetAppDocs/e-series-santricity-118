You can deactivate asynchronous mirroring on the local and remote storage arrays to re-establish normal use of dedicated ports on the storage arrays.

.Before you begin

* You must have deleted all mirror relationships. Verify that all mirror consistency groups and mirrored pairs have been deleted from the local and remote storage arrays.
* The local storage array and the remote storage array must be connected through a Fibre Channel fabric or iSCSI interface.

.About this task

When you deactivate asynchronous mirroring, no mirror activity can occur on the local and remote storage arrays.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Asynchronous Mirroring].
. Select menu:Uncommon Tasks[Deactivate].
+
The system displays a confirmation.

. Select *Yes* to confirm.

.Results

* The controller's HBA host channels that were dedicated for asynchronous mirroring communication can now accept host read and write requests.
* None of the volumes in this storage array are able to participate in mirror relationships as either primary volumes or secondary volumes.
