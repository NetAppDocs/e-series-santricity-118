Access Management is a method of configuring user authentication in Unified Manager.

== What authentication methods are available?

The following authentication methods are available:

 ** *Local user roles* -- Authentication is managed through RBAC (role-based access control) capabilities. Local user roles include pre-defined user profiles and roles with specific access permissions.
 ** *Directory services* -- Authentication is managed through an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server and directory service, such as Microsoft's Active Directory.
 ** *SAML* -- Authentication is managed through an Identity Provider (IdP) using SAML 2.0.
