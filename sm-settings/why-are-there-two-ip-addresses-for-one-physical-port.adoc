The EF600 storage array can include two HICs -- one external and one internal.

In this configuration, the external HIC is connected to an internal, auxiliary HIC. Each physical port that you can access from the external HIC has an associated virtual port from the internal HIC.

To achieve maximum 200Gb performance, you must assign a unique IP address for both the physical and virtual ports so the host can establish connections to each. If you do not assign an IP address to the virtual port, the HIC will run at approximately half its capable speed.
