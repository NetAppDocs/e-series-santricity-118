If the controller rejects a connection because it cannot validate the chain of trust for a network server, you can import a certificate from the Trusted tab that allows the controller (acting as a client) to accept communications from that server.

.Before you begin

* You must be logged in with a user profile that includes Security admin permissions. Otherwise, certificate functions do not appear.
* The certificate files are installed on your local system.

.About this task

Importing certificates from the Trusted tab might be necessary if you want to allow another server to contact the controllers (for example, an LDAP server or a syslog server that uses TLS).

.Steps

. Select menu:Settings[Certificates].
. From the Trusted tab, select *Import*.
+
A dialog box opens for importing the trusted certificate files.

. Click *Browse* to select the certificate files for the controllers.
+
The file names display in the dialog box.

. Click *Import*.

.Results

The files are uploaded and validated.
