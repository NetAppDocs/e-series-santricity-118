[.lead]
You can enable or disable the legacy management interface (SYMbol), which is a method of communication between the storage array and the management client.

.About this task

By default, the legacy management interface is on. If you disable it, the storage array and management client will use a more secure method of communication (REST API over https); however, certain tools and tasks might be affected if it is disabled.

[NOTE]
====
For the EF600 storage system, this feature is disabled by default.
====

The setting affects operations as follows:

* *On* (default) -- Required setting for configuring mirroring with the CLI and some other tools, such as the OCI adapter.
* *Off* -- Required setting to enforce confidentiality in communications between the storage array and the management client, and to access external tools. Recommended setting when configuring a Directory Server (LDAP).

.Steps

. Select menu:Settings[System].
. Scroll down to *Additional Settings*, and then click *Change Management Interface*.
. In the dialog box, click *Yes* to continue.
