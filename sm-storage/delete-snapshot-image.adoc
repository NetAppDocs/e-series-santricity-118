[.lead]
You delete snapshot images to clean up the oldest snapshot image from a snapshot group or snapshot consistency group.

.About this task

You can delete a single snapshot image, or you can delete snapshot images from snapshot consistency groups that have the same creation timestamp. You also can delete snapshot images from a snapshot group.

You cannot delete a snapshot image if it is not the oldest snapshot image for the associated base volume or snapshot consistency group.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Snapshots].
. Click the *Snapshot Images* tab.
. Select the snapshot image that you want to delete, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.
+
If you selected a snapshot image of a snapshot consistency group, select each member volume that you want to delete, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.

. Click *Delete*.

.Results

System Manager performs the following actions:

* Deletes the snapshot image from the storage array.
* Releases the reserved capacity for reuse within the snapshot group or snapshot consistency group.
* Disables all the associated snapshot volumes that exist for the deleted snapshot image.
* From a snapshot consistency group deletion, moves any member volume associated with the deleted snapshot image to a Stopped state.
