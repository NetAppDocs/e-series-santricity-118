You can enable host connectivity reporting so the storage array continuously monitors the connection between the controllers and the configured hosts, and then alerts you if the connection is disrupted. This feature is enabled by default.

.About this task

If you disable host connectivity reporting, the system no longer monitors connectivity or multipath driver issues with a host connected to the storage array.

[NOTE]
====
Disabling host connectivity reporting also disables automatic load balancing, which monitors and balances controller resource utilization.
