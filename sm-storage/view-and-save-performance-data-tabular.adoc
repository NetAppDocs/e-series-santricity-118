You can view and save performance graphs data in tabular format. This allows you to filter the data you want displayed.

.Steps

. From any performance data graph, click *Launch table view*.
+
A table appears that lists all the performance data for the selected objects.

. Use the object selection pull-down and the filter as needed.
. Click the *Show/Hide Columns* button to select the columns you want to include in the table.
+
You can click each check box to select or deselect an item.

. Select *Export* at the bottom of the screen to save the tabular view to a file of comma-separated values (CSV).
+
The Export Table dialog box appears, indicating the number of rows to be exported and the file format of the export (comma-separated values, or CSV format).

. Click *Export* to proceed with the download, or click *Cancel*.
+
Depending on your browser settings, the file is either saved, or you are prompted to choose a name and location for the file.

The default file name format is `performanceStatistics-yyyy-mm-dd_hh-mm-ss.csv`, which includes the date and time when the file was exported.
