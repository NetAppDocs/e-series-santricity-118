You can add a new member volume to an existing snapshot consistency group. When you add a new member volume, you also must reserve capacity for the member volume.

.Before you begin

* The member volume must be Optimal.
* The snapshot consistency group must have less than the maximum number of allowable volumes (as defined by your configuration).
* Each reserved capacity volume must have the same Data Assurance (DA) and security settings as the associated member volume.

.About this task

You can add standard volumes or thin volumes to the snapshot consistency group. The base volume can reside in either a pool or volume group.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Snapshots].
. Select the *Snapshot Consistency Groups* tab.
+
The table appears and displays all the snapshot consistency groups associated with the storage array.

. Select the snapshot consistency group you want to modify, and then click *Add Members*.
+
The Add Members dialog box appears.

. Select the member volume(s) you want to add, and then click *Next*.
+
The Reserve Capacity step appears. The Volume Candidate table displays only the candidates that support the reserved capacity specified.

. Use the spinner box to allocate the reserved capacity for the member volume. Do one of the following actions:
 ** *Accept the default settings.*
+
Use this recommended option to allocate the reserved capacity for the member volume with the default settings.

 ** *Allocate your own reserved capacity settings to meet your data storage needs.*
+
If you change the default reserved capacity setting, click *Refresh Candidates* to refresh the candidate list for the reserved capacity you specified.
+
Allocate the reserved capacity using the following guidelines.

*** The default setting for reserved capacity is 40% of the capacity of the base volume, and usually this capacity is sufficient.
*** The capacity needed varies, depending on the frequency and size of I/O writes to the volumes and the quantity and duration of snapshot image collection.
. Click *Finish* to add the member volumes.
