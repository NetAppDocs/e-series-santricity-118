summary: "When a zero is displayed for a data point in the graphs and table, it means there is no I/O activity for the object for that point in time. This situation could occur because the host is not initiating I/O to that object, or it could be a problem with the object itself."

When a zero is displayed for a data point in the graphs and table, it means there is no I/O activity for the object for that point in time. This situation could occur because the host is not initiating I/O to that object, or it could be a problem with the object itself.

The historical data for the object is still available for viewing. The graphs and table will show non-zero data once I/O activity begins occurring for the object.

The following table lists the most common reasons why a data point value might be zero for any given object.
