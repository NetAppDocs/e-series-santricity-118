You can create volumes using either a pool or a volume group. The best selection depends primarily on the key storage requirements such as the expected I/O workload, the performance requirements, and the data protection requirements.

== Reasons to choose a pool or volume group

*Choose a pool*

* If you need faster drive rebuilds and simplified storage administration, require thin volumes, and/or have a highly random workload.
* If you want to distribute the data for each volume randomly across a set of drives that comprise the pool.
+
You cannot set or change the RAID level of pools or the volumes in the pools. Pools use RAID level 6.

*Choose a volume group*

* If you need maximum system bandwidth, the ability to tune storage settings, and a highly sequential workload.
* If you want to distribute the data across the drives based on a RAID level. You can specify the RAID level when you create the volume group.
* If you want to write the data for each volume sequentially across the set of drives that comprise the volume group.

[NOTE]
====
Because pools can co-exist with volume groups, a storage array can contain both pools and volume groups.

== Feature differences between pools and volume groups

The following table provides a feature comparison between volume groups and pools.

Performance (optimal mode)
a|
Good: Best for small block, random workload.

== Functional comparison of pools and volume groups

The function and purpose of a pool and a volume group are the same. Both objects are a set of drives logically grouped together in a storage array and are used to create volumes that a host can access.

The following table helps you decide whether a pool or volume group best suits your storage needs.

| Function| Pool| Volume Group
a|
Different RAID level supported

Yes
a|
No
a|
Full disk encryption (FDE) supported
a|
Yes
a|
Yes
a|
Data Assurance (DA) supported
a|
Yes
a|
Yes
a|
Shelf loss protection supported
a|
Yes
a|
Yes
a|
Drawer loss protection supported
a|
Yes
a|
Yes
a|
Mixed drive speeds supported
a|
Recommended to be the same, but not required. Slowest drive determines speed for all drives.
a|
Recommended to be the same, but not required. Slowest drive determines speed for all drives.
a|
Mixed drive capacity supported
a|
Recommended to be the same, but not required. Smallest drive determines capacity for all drives.
a|
Recommended to be the same, but not required. Smallest drive determines capacity for all drives.
a|
Minimum number of drives
a|
11
a|
Depends on RAID level. RAID 0 needs 1. RAID 1 or 10 needs 2 (requires an even number). RAID 5 minimum is 3. RAID 6 minimum is 5.
a|
Maximum number of drives
a|
Up to the maximum limit for the storage array
a|
RAID 1 and 10--up to the maximum limit of the storage array RAID 5, 6--30 drives
a|
Can choose individual drives when creating a volume
a|
No
a|
Yes
a|
Can specify segment size when creating a volume
a|
Yes. 128K supported.
a|
Yes
a|
Can specify I/O characteristics when creating a volume
a|
No
a|
Yes. File system, database, multimedia, and custom supported.
a|
Drive failure protection
a|
Uses preservation capacity on each drive in the pool making reconstruction faster.
a|
Uses a hot spare drive. Reconstruction is limited by the IOPs of the drive.
a|
Warning when reaching capacity limit
a|
Yes. Can set an alert when used capacity reaches a percentage of the maximum capacity.
a|
No
a|
Migration to a different storage array supported
a|
No. Requires that you migrate to a volume group first.
