The Performance page provides easy ways for you to monitor the performance of your storage array.

== What can I learn from performance data?
The Performance graphs and tables show performance data in near real-time, which helps you determine whether a storage array is experiencing problems. You can also save performance data to construct a historical view of a storage array and identify when a problem started or what caused a problem.
