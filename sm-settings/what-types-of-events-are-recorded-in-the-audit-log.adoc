[.lead]
The audit log can record modification events, or both modification and read-only events.

Depending on the policy settings, the following types of events are shown:

* *Modification events* -- User actions from within System Manager that involve changes to the system, such as provisioning storage.
* *Modification and read-only events* -- User actions that involve changes to the system, as well as events that involve viewing or downloading information, such as viewing volume assignments.
